Hi	0
Savannah	1
This	0
is	0
a	0
pretty	0

issue;	0
one	0
person	0
feels	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
doing	0
a	0
great	0
job	0
of	0
being	0
loving	1
yet	0
their	0
partner	0

There's	0
a	0
great	0
book	0
"The	0
Five	0
Love	0
Languages"	0
by	0
Gary	0
Chapman	2
He	0
explains	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
five	0
main	0
ways	0
to	0
give	0
and	0
receive	0
love	1
but	0
we	0
don't	0
necessarily	0
all	0
speak	0
the	0
same	0
"love	0
language"	0
as	0
our	0
partner	2
You	0
might	0
feel	0
that	0
by	0
going	0
out	0
to	0
work	0
and	0
earn	0
money	1
you're	0
being	0
loving	1
but	0
if	0
your	0
partner's	0
main	0
love	0
language	0
is	0
quality	0
time	1
you're	0
not	0
hitting	0
that	0
bulls	0
eye	0
because	0
you're	0
not	0
home!	0

and	0
you	0

your	0

a	0
bit	0
better	2
You	0
may	0
never	0
be	0
fluent	1

you	0
can	0
get	0
better	2
The	0
most	0

to	0

nothing	0

Hi	0
Calgary	0
(Canada!)	1
 Let	0
me	0
get	0
this	0
straight...you're	0
in	0
a	0
'relationship'	1
but	0
he	0
might	0
be	0
married	2
You	0
both	0
cheat	0
and	0
lie	0
and	0
he's	0
abusive	2
The	0
short	0
answer	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
too	0
much	0
wrong	0
here	0
for	0
this	0
therapist	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
fix	0
it	2
Relationships	0
don't	0
heal	0
us	0
and	0
they	0
don't	0
help	0
us	0
grow	0
up	2
We	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
mature	0
and	0
stable	0
enough	0
to	0
love	0
someone	0
before	0
it's	0
going	0
to	0
work	2
I'd	0
recommend	0
you	0
focus	0
on	0
yourself	0
alone	0
for	0
a	0
while	2
You	0
have	0
a	0
lot	0
to	0
sort	0
out	2
I	0
wish	0
you	0
the	0
best	2
You'll	0
only	0
find	0
out	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
it	0
is	0
"too	0
late"	1
by	0
following	0
through	0
with	0
wanting	0
to	0
message	0
him.Regardless	0
of	0
whether	0
the	0
response	0
you	0
receive	0
is	0
what	0
you'd	0
hoped	0
to	0
hear	1
including	0
not	0
hearing	0
back	0
from	0
him	1
you	0
will	0
have	0
done	0
yourself	0
a	0
great	0
honor	0
and	0
respect	0
by	0
following	0
through	0
on	0
a	0
wish	0
and	0
curiosity	0
you've	0
had	0
for	0
some	0
time	2
Something	0
to	0
remember	0
about	0
anxiety	0
is	0
that	0
it's	0
a	0
useful	0
and	0
necessary	0
response	0
to	0
stressors	1
and	0
we	0
all	0
have	0
a	0
level	0
of	0
anxiety	0
that	0
falls	0
somewhere	0
on	0
the	0
spectrum	0
from	0
very	0
slight	0
to	0
very	0
overwhelming	2
Anxiety	0
is	0
our	0
brain's	0
way	0
of	0
prompting	0
us	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
the	0
stress	0
in	0
our	0
lives	0
by	0
getting	0
us	0
geared	0
up	0
for	0
action. Some	0
helpful	0
ways	0
of	0
managing	0
anxiety	0
are	0
actually	0
very	0
simple	2
The	0
first	0
I'd	0
recommend	0
is	0
a	0
calm	0
breathing	0
technique	0
-	0
breathe	0
in	0
for	0
4-5	0
seconds	1
and	0
then	0
out	0
for	0
7-8	0
seconds	2
Try	0
to	0
repeat	0
this	0
for	0
3-5	0
minutes	2
Another	0
suggestion	0
is	0
to	0
pay	0
closer	0
attention	0
in	0
the	0
moments	0
you	0
feel	0
the	0
physical	0
symptoms	0
of	0
anxiety	0
and	0
see	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
describe	0
-	0
without	0
judging	0
-	0
the	0
sensations	0
to	0
yourself	2
Try	0
to	0
be	0
very	0
specific	1
such	0
as	0
"my	0
palms	0
are	0
feeling	0
very	0
sweaty	1
and	0
I	0
can	0
feel	0
the	0
slight	0
tightness	0
and	0
fluttering	0
in	0
my	0
belly	0
of	0
the	0
butterflies."	0
Then	0
try	0
to	0
sit	0
with	0
these	0
sensations	0
without	0
deciding	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
good	0
or	0
bad	0
-	0
just	0
experiencing	0
them	0
as	0
intentionally	0
as	0
possible	2
 Combining	0
the	0
calm	0
breathing	0
with	0
this	0
technique	0
can	0
also	0
be	0
very	0
helpful. If	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
these	0
techniques	0
don't	0
help	0
and	0
your	0
anxiety	0
about	0
everyday	0
stressors	0
are	0
inhibiting	0
you	0
from	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
life	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
want	0
to	1
then	0
I'd	0
highly	0
recommend	0
going	0
for	0
an	0
assessment	0
or	0
even	0
just	0
consultation	0
with	0
a	0
professional	2
This	0
professional	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
determine	0
if	0

a	0
word	0
of	0
caution	2
In	0
my	0

very	0
deep	0
discussions	0
with	0

When	0

Hi!	0
Thank	0

your	0
question	2
It's	0

to	0
be	0
in	0
a	0
healthy	0
and	0
loving	0
relationship	0
when	0
we	0
believe	0
we	0
are	0
not	0
worth	0
it	2
Quite	0
often	0
being	0
in	0
such	0
a	0
relationship	0
is	0
very	0
uncomfortable	0
as	0
it	0
goes	0
against	0
everything	0
we	0
believe	0
about	0
ourselves. First	1
I	0
want	0
to	0
say	0
you	0
are	0
very	0

to	0

up	0
yourself	0

the	0

this	0

yourself	2
Doing	0
something	0

Acknowledge	0
that	0
what	0
you	0
are	0

uncomfortable	0

that	0
it	0
will	0
take	0
some	0
time	0
to	0
get	0
used	0
to	0
it. Don't	0
judge	0
yourself	0
and	0
force	0
yourself	0
to	0
feel	0
a	0

Hi, Reaching	0
out	0
on	0
this	0

was	0
a	0
great	0
first	0
step!	0
To	0
start	0
counseling	1
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
looking	0
up	0
counselors	0
and	0
thinking	0
about	0
what	0
sort	0
of	0
counselor	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
fit	2
See	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
areas	0
of	0
focus	0
that	0
line	0
up	0
with	0
your	0
goals	1
and	0
never	0
be	0
afraid	0
to	0
call	0
and	0
set	0
up	0
a	0
consultation	2
Usually	0
these	0
are	0
free	0
of	0
charge	0
and	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
make	0
your	0
decision	2
It's	0
hard	0
to	0
say	0
what	0
is	0
okay	0
and	0
what	0
is	0
not	0
okay	1
as	0
it	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
husband	0
feel	0
is	0
appropriate	0
in	0
your	0
relationship	2
If	0

that	0

how	0
you	0

then	0
that	0
sounds	0

a	0
problem	2
I	0
would	0

having	0
an	0
open	0
discussion	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
about	0
communication	0
between	0
the	0
two	0
of	0

there	0
is	0

no	0
conflict	0

emotions	0

try	0
and	0
see	0
his	0
perspective	0
and	0
understand	0
why	0
he	0
shuts	0
you	0
down	2
Perhaps	1
he	0
feels	0
like	0
he	0
is	0
being	0
told	0
what	0
to	0
do	0
constantly	0
or	0
that	0
he	0
gets	0

you	2
An	0

nothing	0

then	0
the	0
next	0

for	0

of	0

the	0
choice	0
is	0
to	0
tolerate	0
being	0
triggered	0
or	0
to	0
dissolve	0
the	0

then	0
your	0
decision	0
is	0
which	0
of	0
these	0
two	0
choices	0
is	0
better	0
for	0
you.Since	0
you	0
already	0
know	0
you	0
don't	0

to	0
be	0

parting	0

as	0
soon	0
as	0
reasonably	0
possible	1
seems	0
the	0
choice	0
you	0
prefer.Either	0
choice	0
is	0
fine	2
 Let	0
the	0

depend	0
on	0
which	0

you	0

life	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
reaching	0
out	0
to	0
ask	0
for	0
help	2
Surely	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
confusing	0
time	0
for	0
you!	0
If	0
you	0
have	0
never	0
had	0
these	0
feelings	0
and	0
desires	0
it	0
could	0
certainty	0
shake	0
everything	0
you	0
thought	0
you	0
knew	0
about	0
yourself	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
becoming	0
sick	0
around	0
the	0
time	0
that	0
this	0
started	0
is	0
likely	0
a	0
coincidence	1
but	0
I	0
understand	0
how	0
you	0
would	0
make	0
the	0
connection	2
I	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	0
that	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
may	0
be	0
going	0
on	0
here	2
It	0
is	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
say	0
since	0
I	0
don’t	0
know	0
you	1
how	0
old	0
you	0
are	1
etc	2
But	1
I	0
will	0
share	0
you	0
with	0
you	0
some	0
thoughts	2
Some	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
have	0
undesirable	0
thoughts	0
that	0
really	0
surprise	0
them	1
have	0
a	0
really	0
tough	0
time	0
getting	0
rid	0
of	0
them	2
Our	0
reaction	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
strong	0
and	0
our	0
tendency	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
block	0
it	0
out	1
stuff	0
it	1
avoid	0
it	1
etc	2
is	0
not	0
always	0
successful	2
In	0
fact	1
it’s	0
usually	0
not	2
It’s	0
like	0
telling	0
you	0
not	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
pink	0
elephants	2
I	0
would	0
be	0
willing	0
to	0
bet	0
that	0
you	0
thought	0
of	0
a	0
pink	0
elephant	0
just	0
now	2
So	1
rather	0
than	0
fighting	0
thoughts	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
confusing	1
sometimes	0
it	0
is	0
helpful	0
to	0
allow	0
yourself	0
to	0
explore	0
the	0
thought	0
with	0
curiosity	0
and	0
without	0
judgement	2
Where	0
is	0
this	0
thought	0
coming	0
from	3
What	0
are	0
my	0

it	3
Asking	0
yourself	0
these	0
questions	0
may	0
help	0
you	0
come	0
to	0
a	0
resolution	0
about	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
on	2
One	0
possibility	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
developed	0
an	0
anxiety	0
about	0
your	0
thoughts	0
and	0
now	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
process	0
of	0
obsessing	0
about	0
them	1
but	0
another	0
possibility	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
legitimately	0
exploring	0
your	0
sexuality	0
and	0
gender	2
I	0
get	0
the	0
feeling	0
from	0
your	0
question	0
that	0
you	0
do	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
believe	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
second	0
possibility	2
And	0
that	0
is	0
okay	2
You	0
can	0
try	0
some	0
of	0
my	0
suggestions	1
but	0
you	0
can	0
also	0
see	0
a	0
counselor	0
who	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
work	0
through	0
your	0
confusion	2
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
someone	0
who	0
has	0
experience	0
working	0
with	0
sexuality	0
issues	2
You	0
can	0
usually	0
find	0
out	0
what	0
a	0
counselor	0
works	0
with	0
on	0
their	0
website	2
What	0
is	0
important	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
non-judgmental	0

 A	0
technique	0
I	0
like	0
to	0
use	0
is	0
meditation	0

mindfulness	2
 This	0

teach	0

not	0

these	0

everyday	0
over	0
and	0
over	0
(even	0
if	0
at	0
first	0
you	0
don't	0

can	0

it)	2
 I	0
have	0
even	0
wrote	0
positive	0
mantras	0
to	0
myself	0
in	0

I	0

look	0
at	0
these	0
throughout	0
the	0

remember	0
to	0
not	0
be	0
hard	0

took	0
a	0

where	0

 So	0
allow	0
the	0
process	0

Going	0
to	0

a	0
experience	0
counselor	0

my	0
advice	2
 You	0
will	0
have	0
a	0
neutral	0
person	0
that	0
can	0
listen	0
to	0
both	0
sides	0
and	0
help	0
you	0
all	0
find	0
a	0
common	0
ground	0
of	0
understanding	2
 If	0
she	0
doesn't	0
agree	0
to	0
counseling	1
really	0
the	0
only	0
person	0
you	0
can	0
change	0
is	0
you	2
 I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
approach	0
her	0
with	0
love	0
and	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
appreciate	0
about	0
her	1
let	0
her	0
know	0
the	0
great	0
things	0
she	0
have	0
done	0
that	0
could	0
not	0
be	0
replaced	0

however	0
you	0
want	0
your	0
relationship	0
to	0
get	0
better	0
than	0
it	0
has	0
been	0
lately	2
 Hopefully	0
this	0
will	0
open	0
the	0
door	0
of	0
communication	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
explain	0

Hi	0
Louisiana,You	0
say	0
that	0
the	0
problems	0
are	0
with	0
your	0
"past"	1
but	0
my	0
hunch	0
is	0
the	0
problems	0
are	0
about	0
his	0
insecurity	0
and	0
his	0
personal	0
barriers	0
to	0
trust	0
(unless	0
you've	0
recently	0
revealed	0
details	0
of	0
a	0
sordid	0
past?)	2
You	0
don't	0
mention	0
ever	0
having	0
hurt	0
the	0
trust	0
in	0
the	0
relationship.Trust	0
is	0
the	0
first	0
stage	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	2
Moving	0
forward	0
before	0
they	0
develop	0
trust	0
is	0
a	0
common	0
mistake	0
couples	0
make	1
and	0
now	0
you	0
two	0
have	0
involved	0
children	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
that's	0
missing	0
a	0
crucial	0
element	2
But	0
you	0
didn't	0
see	0
this	0
coming	1
did	0
you	3
That's	0
because	0
only	0
as	0
we	0
become	0
emotionally	0
intimate	0
do	0
our	0
deeper	0
fears	0
and	0
insecurities	0
come	0
to	0
the	0
surface. I	0
give	0
you	0
credit	0
for	0
wanting	0
it	0
to	0
work	1
and	0
I	0
believe	0
you	0
would	0
benefit	0
from	0
the	0
support	0
of	0
a	0
therapist	0
in	0
working	0
through	0
the	0
kinks	0

boundary	0

(e.g.	1

(such	0

we	0

look	0
at	0
the	0

quadrant	0
(thoughts	1

who	0

learned	0
to	0

that	0
come	0
up	0
during	0

look	0
for	0
ways	0

and/or	0
reshape	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
view	0
sex	0
and	0
its	0
challenges. 	0
It	0
would	0
be	0
here	0
that	0
we	0
would	0
see	0
whether	0
one	0
is	0
even	0
comfortable	0
using	0
a	0
service	0
like	0
counseling	0
based	0
upon	0
how	0
your	0
family/culture	0
of	0
origin	0
views	0
the	0
profession. Finally	1
we	0
would	0
need	0
to	0
account	0
for	0
challenges	0
that	0
show	0
up	0
in	0
the	0
lower	0
right	0
quadrant	0
(systems	1

Once	0

it	0

your	0
question	0

of	0
why	0

we	0

to	0

several	2
 I	0

this	0

Well	1
as	0

as	0
your	0

from	0

Leaving	0

this	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
Being	0
bisexual	0
can	0
be	0
particularly	0
difficult	0
because	0
it	0
is	0
often	0
misunderstood	1
even	0
by	0
people	0
who	0
are	0
“supposed”	0
to	0
be	0
part	0
of	0
your	0
own	0
community	1
such	0
as	0
lesbians	0
and	0
gays	2
It	0
happens	0
so	0
often	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
actually	0
a	0
term	0
for	0
it	0
– 	0
bi-erasure	2
This	0
is	0
simply	0
something	0
that	0
happens	0
when	0
people	0
deny	0
that	0
bisexuality	0
is	0
a	0
real	0
thing	1
or	0
discriminate	0
against	0
bisexuals	0
due	0
to	0
beliefs	0
like	0
your	0
parents	0
seem	0
to	0
have	2
The	0
unfortunate	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
never	0
be	0
sure	0
of	0
how	0
you	0
parents	0
may	0
take	0
this	0
kind	0
of	0
information	2
It	0
sounds	0
promising	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
accepting	0
of	0
other	0
sexual	0
orientations	1
and	0
it	0
may	0
simply	0
be	0
that	0
your	0
parents	0
lack	0
education	0
about	0
bisexuality	2
With	0
accurate	0
information	1
they	0
may	0
come	0
around	1
but	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
be	0
sure	2
Some	0
of	0
my	0
colleagues	0
have	0
already	0
given	0
you	0
good	0
information	2
Here	0
are	0
some	0
more things	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
consider	0
and	0
questions	0
you	0
can	0
ask	0
yourself	0
before	0
making	0
the	0
decision	0
to	0
tell	0
them:	0
 	0
1.     	0
If	0
they	0
don’t	0
respond	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
want	0
them	0
to	1
have	0
you	0
developed	0
a	0
support	0
system	0
to	0
support	0
you	0
through	0
it	3
This	0
is	0
very	0
important	2
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
all	0
the	0
friends	0
in	0
the	0
world	0
won’t	0
prevent	0
pain	0
or	0
sadness	0
if	0
your	0
parents	0
don’t	0
respond	0
as	0
you	0
hope	1
but	0
they	0
will	0
at	0
least	0
be	0
there	0
to	0
remind	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
ARE	0
okay	0
as	0
you	0
are	2
And	0
that	0
is	0
critical	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
remember	2
 	0
2.     	0
There	0
is	0
great	0
information	0
on	0
the	0
internet	0
about	0
bisexuality	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
offer	0
your	0
parents	0
if	0
you	0
think	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
helpful	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
important	0
for	0
them	0
to	0
know	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
damage	0
that	0
is	0
being	0
done	0
to	0
bisexual	0
adults	0
and	0
young	0
people	0
because	0
of	0
the	0
myths	0

Coming	0
out	0
to	0
people	0
is	0
obviously	0
deeply	0
personal	0
and	0
should	0
only	0
take	0
place	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
ready	2
Sometimes	0
people	0
get	0
pressured	0
from	0
friends	1
media	1
and	0
even	0
people	0
they	0
are	0
romantically	0
involved	0
with	0
to	0
come	0
out	0
before	0
they	0
are	0
ready	2
It	0
really	0
is	0
up	0
to	0
you	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
pressure	0
from	0
others	1
don’t	0
feel	0
bad	0
about	0
setting	0
your	0
boundaries	0
and	0
telling	0
them	0
that	0
you	0
will	0
come	0
out	0
on	0
your	0
own	0
time	2
Intimate	0
partners	0

respect	0
you	0
enough	0
to	0
understand	0
this	2
 	0
4.     	0
Something	0
else	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
is	0
your	0
own	0
comfort	0
in	0
being	0
bisexual	2
Just	0
because	0
someone	0
is	0
LGBTQ	0
doesn’t	0
mean	0
that	0
they	0
necessarily	0
want	0
to	0
be	2
Many	0
people	0
struggle	0
with	0
this	2
Having	0
your	0
own	0
doubts	0
or	0
insecurities	0
may	0
also	0
play	0
a	0
part	0
in	0
how	0
comfortable	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
telling	0
your	0
parents	2
So	1
perhaps	0
do	0
some	0
self-exploration	0
about	0
your	0
feelings	0
toward	0
yourself	2
 	0
Sometimes	0
people	0
take	0
friends	0
with	0
them	0
when	0
they	0
decide	0
to	0
come	0
out	0
to	0
their	0
parents	2
This	0
is	0
something	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
consider	2
The	0
important	0
thing	0
to	0
remember	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
okay	2
Really	2
If	0
your	0
parents	0
don’t	0
respond	0
well	1
that	0
doesn’t	0
mean	0
that	0
they	0
never	0
will	2
Some	0
start	0
off	0
upset	1

a	0
tough	0
spot	2
I	0
have	0
a	0
few	0
thoughts	0
and	0
perhaps	0
some	0
colleagues	0
will	0
add	0
some	0
things	2
You	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
a	0
few	0
minutes	0
calling	0
to	0
mind	0
any	0
conversations	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
had	0
with	0
your	0

about	0
transgender	0
issues	1
or	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
ever	0
heard	0
him	0
talk	0
about	0
it	2
That	0

give	0
you	0
a	0
small	0
clue	0
about	0
how	0
well	0
he	0
may	0
accept	0
this	0
news	0
from	0
you	2
For	0
example	1
if	0
he	0
has	0
been	0
watching	0
the	0

lately	1
transgender	0
rights	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
is	0
being	0
talked	0
about	0
a	0
lot	2
Has	0
he	0
had	0
an	0
opinion	3
This	0
won't	0
tell	0
you	0
for	0
sure	0
if	0
he	0
would	0
be	0
okay	0
with	0
learning	0
you	0
are	0
transgender	1
but	0
at	0

you	0
would	0
know	0
if	0
there	0
is	0
hostility	0
toward	0
transgender	0
people	2
To	0
tell	0
you	0
the	0

the	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
tell	0
your	0

whatever	0

you	2
There	0
is	0
no	0
right	0
or	0

way	1

If	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
tell	0
him	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
by	0
yourself	0
with	0
him	3
That's	0
perfect	2

Equally	0
perfect	2
Whatever	0
thing	0
you	0
need	0
to	0

And	1
of	0
course	1
there	0
is	0
always	0
the	0
option	0
of	0
not	0
telling	0
him	0
anything	0
until	0
you	0
are	0
comfortable	0
doing	0
so	2
Unfortunately	1
the	0
response	0
from	0
your	0

can't	0
be	0
predicted	2
Some	0
parents	0
are	0
totally	0
cool...	2
others	0
not	0
so	0
much	2
This	0
is	0
one	0
reason	0
why	0
having	0
someone	0
with	0
your	0
for	0
support	0
is	0
sometimes	0
a	0
good	0
idea	2
If	0
things	0
get	0
heated	1
you	0
have	0
someone	0
in	0
your	0

There	0
are	0
therapists	0

it	0
is	0
awkward	0

may	0
not	0

at	0
all	2

if	0
a	0

only	0
jokes	1
then	0
after	0
laughing	0
and	0
realizing	0
the	0
person	0
has	0
nothing	0
of	0
themselves	0
to	0
offer	1
this	0
can	0
also	0
be	0
quite	0
tedious.Realize	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
more	0
aware	0
of	0
human	0
interaction	0
having	0
many	0
levels	0
of	0

 You	0

The	0
more	0
you	0

"Complacency	0

on	0

about	0

that	0

that	0

you	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
know	0
about	0
him	1
and	0
know	0
him	0
intimately	0
again	2
First	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
tell	0
your	0

the	0
reasons	0
you	0
feel	0

way	0
he	0
has	0
a	0

is	0
a	0
difference	0
between	0
his	0
unavailability	0
due	0
to	0
a	0

Sometimes	0

why	0

it	0
seem	0

to	0

it	0
sometimes	3
If	0

you'll	0

So	0
people	0

that	0

These	0
are	0
self-sabotaging	0

If	0

For	0
some	0
people	1
having	0
a	0
sense	0

some	0
time.You	0

that	0
you	0

an	0

some	0

I	0

if	0
you	0

look	0
at	0

what	0

a	0

If	0
you	0

who	0
you	0

a	0

so	0
I	0
wonder	0
what	0
keeps	0
them	0
from	0
feeling	0
close	2
I	0
have	0
also	0
wondering	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
emotionally	0
hurt	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
and	0
if	0
so	1
you	0

you	0

(maybe	0

again	2
Remember	0
that	0
this	0

a	0

in	0

on	0

make	0
an	0
infinite	0
amount	0
of	0
adjustments	0
or	0
changes	0
with	0
different	0
people	0

what	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
in	0
your	0
"home,"	0
and	0
how	0
you	0

it	2

After	0

that	0
you	0

have	2

there	0

your	0

rule	0
out	0
any	0

causes	0
to	0
your	0

I	0
would	0
work	0
with	0
you	0
on	0
deciding	0
which	0
of	0
these	0
issues	0
to	0
tackle	0
first. 	0
I	0
usually	0
suggest	0
starting	0
with	0
the	0
issue	0
that	0
is	0
easiest. 	0
Reading	0
through	0
your	0
symptoms	0
I	0
might	0
choose	0
anxiety	0
to	0
start	0
with	0
since	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
early	0
stages	0
of	0
it. 	0
I	0
like	0
to	0
give	0
my	0
client	0
skills	0
they	0
can	0
use	0
right	0
away	1
so	0
I	0
would	0
focus	0
on	0
teaching	0
you	0
breathing	0
exercises	0
to	0
manage	0
the	0
anxiety	0
as	0
well	0
as	0
cognitive	0
restructuring	0
so	0
that	0
when	0
an	0
anxious	0
thought	0
pops	0
up	0
you	0
can	0
talk	0
yourself	0
through	0
it. 	0
Once	0
you	0
felt	0
that	0
you	0
had	0
some	0
control	0
over	0
the	0
anxiety	0
I'd	0
start	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
some	0
of	0
your	0
other	0
concerns	1
but	0
I	0
would	0
seek	0
your	0
input	0

what	0
you	0
felt	0
like	0
might	0
be	0
good	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
next. 	0
My	0
gut	0
is	0
that	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
issues	0
would	0
be	0
resolved	0
as	0
you	0
worked	0
on	0

of	0
smoking	0
cigarettes	0
while	0

about	0

a	0

comes	0
up	2
 My	0
suggestions	0
are	0
to	0
imagine	0
smoking	0
if	0

relieve	0

do	0
the	0
opposite	0

all	0
the	0
good	0
reasons	0
to	0
not	0
smoke.Also	1
since	0
you're	0
planning	0

ask	0
your	0

ideas	0
on	0
how	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
psychological	0
feeling	0
to	0

feel	0
less	0
intense.Another	0
suggestion	0

that	0
your	0

your	0

to	0
stop	0
smoking	2

  Having	0

for	0

of	0

also	0
because	0
of	0
the	0
lack	0
of	0

that	0
comes	0
along	0
with	0
it	2
Even	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
spectacular	0
communication	0
while	0
in	0
a	0
long-distance	0
relationship	1
it	0
is	0
difficult	0

the	0
challenges	0
that	0
you	0
face	1
but	0
there	0
are	0
some	0
ways	0
to	0
improve	0
your	0
odds. The	0
first	0
thing	0
to	0
remember	0
here	0
is	0
that	0
dating	0
is	0
all	0
about	0
finding	0
a	0
person	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
eventually	0
dedicate	0
your	0
time	1
resources	1

to	2

that	0
the	0

that	0
you	0

not	0

it	0
is	0
better	0
to	0

out	0
and	0
have	0
the	0
opportunity	0
to	0
date	0
others	0
before	0
a	0
commitment	0
is	0
made	2
The	0
second	0
thing	0
to	0
remember	0
is	0
that	0
open	0
communication	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
sign	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	2
That	0
being	0
said	1
I	0
do	0
not	0
believe	0
that	0
sharing	0

about	0
your	0
"crushes"	0

the	0
best	0
thing	0
for	0
a	0

the	0

It	0
is	0
a	0
wonderful	0
thing	0
when	0
we	0
can	0
feel	0
that	0
we	0
have	0
given	0
our	0
best	0
efforts	0
on	0
something	1
especially	0
something	0
as	0
important	0
as	0
the	0
act	0
of	0
loving. Here	0
are	0
a	0

things	0
that	0
you	0

my	0
opinion	1
if	0

it's	0
time	0
for	0
your	0

it	0
with	0
her	0

Hello, I	0

your	0

She	0

for	0
the	0

it	1
you	0
want	0
to	0

I	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
take	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
contemplate	0
the	0

way	0
and	0
time	0
to	0
approach	0
her. 	0
Rehearse	0
ahead	0
of	0

what	0
you	0
want	0
her	0
to	0
hear	0
and	0
what	0
the	0
end	0
goal	0
is. 	0
I	0
know	0
it	0

perhaps	0
you	0
even	0
feel	0
frustrated	0
about	0
that	1
but	0
the	0
only	0
way	0
you	0
will	0
reach	0
her	0
is	0
if	0
you	0

it	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
she	0
hears	0
your	0
concern	0
and	0
desire	0
to	0

her. 	0
Be	0

for	0
help. 	0
The	0
better	0
prepared	0
you	0
are	1
the	0
better	0
the	0
chances	0

her	0

Hi	0
Chapel	0
Hill, I	0
like	0
your	0
goal;	0
research	0
is	0
telling	0
us	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
that	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
keys	0
to	0
happiness	0
is	0
having	0
healthy	0
relationships	2
If	0
we	0
feel	0
successful	0
in	0
that	0
area	1
it	0
can	0
give	0
us	0
the	0
confidence	0
and	0
hope	0
to	0
tackle	0
anything	0
life	0
throws	0
at	0
us.There	0
are	0
personal	0
barriers	0
we	0
all	0
have	0
to	0
having	0
healthy	0
relationships;	0
it's	0
our	0
"stuff"	1
our	0
"baggage"	0
(not	0
a	0
steam	0
trunk	1
right...you	0
have	0
a	0
cute	0
little	0
Gucci	0
bag!). You	0
hint	0
that	0
people	0
may	0
have	0
hurt	0
you	0
in	0
the	0
past	2
Maybe	0
fear	0
says	0
"stay	0
away...hold	0
onto	0
resentment	0
or	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
hurt	0
again!"	2
Resentment	1
or	0
simply	0
focusing	0
on	0
the	0
past	0
is	0
certainly	0
a	0
barrier	0
to	0
improving	0
any	0
relationship	2
Learning	0
to	0
forgive	0
ourselves	0
and	0
others	0
is	0
so	0
important	2
And	0
remember...forgiveness	0
isn't	0
about	0
saying	0
something	0
was	0
okay;	0
it	0
only	0
means	0
"It	0
happened	1
I	0
can't	0
change	0
that	1
and	0
I	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
carry	0
it	0
(anger	1
hurt	1
resentment)	0
around	0
anymore	1
so	0
I	0
let	0
it	0
go." Or...sometimes	0
fear	0
tells	0
us	0
that	0
people	0
won't	0
accept	0
us;	0
this	0
keeps	0
us	0
isolated	0
for	0
sure!	0
But	0
really	1
all	0
fear	0
wants	0
is	0
power	0
over	0
us. Fear	0
is	0
a	0
trickster!	0
It	0
tells	0
us	0
that	0
if	0
we	0
let	0
go	0
of	0
the	0
past	1
we	0
will	0
be	0
rejected	0
or	0
hurt	2
It	0
says	0
"I'm	0
trying	0
to	0
protect	0
you!"	1
but	0
what	0
it	0
REALLY wants	0
is	0
to	0
paralyze	0
and	0
isolate	0
us	0
all	0
so	0
it	0
can	0
feel	0
powerful	2
Once	0
you	0
pull	0
the sheeps	0
clothing	0
off	0
of	0
fear	1
you	0
can	0
see	0
that	0
it	0
doesn't	0
help	0
you	0
at	0
all!Once	0
you	0

where	0
your	0
personal	0
barriers	0
are	1
and	0
you	0
start	0
to	0
refute	0
those	0

you	0
can	0
begin	0
to	0
build	0
new	0
ideas	0
about	0
yourself	0
and	0
other	0
people	0
that	0
are	0
based	0
on	0
compassion	0
instead	0
of	0
fear... Everyone	0
deserves	0
forgiveness	0
and	0
compassion.No	0
one	0
deserves	0
to	0
be	0
judged	0
by	0
their	0
worst	0
moments.If	0

Hello!	0
 Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
 Exploring	0
your	0
sexual	0
orientation	0
and	0
attraction	0
is	0
a	0
wonderful	0
opportunity	0
to	0
get	0
to	0
know	0
yourself!	0
 I	0
would	0
be	0
curious	0
to	0
know	0
what	0
feelings	0
you	0
might	0
have	0
related	0
to	0
the	0
possibility	0
of	0
being	0
bi;	0
What	0
messages	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
received	0
related	0
to	0
this	0
orientation	0
and	0
any	0
concerns	0
you	0
have	0
about	0
possible	0
sexual	0
orientations	2
There	0
is	0
a	0
reason	0
you	0
are	0
having	0
breakdowns. I	0
can't	0
agree	0
that	0
they	0
happen	0
for "no	0
reason	0
at	0
all". 	0
 Finding	0
out	0
the	0
reason	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
your	0
biggest	0
challenge	0
because	0
that	0
may	0
require	0
you	0
to	0
dig	0
deep	0
into	0
your	0
past	1
uncover	0
hurtful	0
experiences	1
or recognize	0
something	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
extremely	0
pain. 	0
However	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
find	0
professional	0
help	0
to	0
carefully	0
guide	0
you	0
through	0
whatever	0
you	0
may confront, the	0
symptoms	0
mentioned	0
will	0
continue	0
and	0
may	0
even	0
get	0
worse. 	0
There	0
is	0
a	0
light	0
at	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
the	0
road	0
but	0
you	0
need some	0
help	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
right	0
road	0
to	0
get	0
on	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
it	2
I	0
think	0
it's	0
crucial	0
that	0
a	0
person	0
finds	0
the	0
"right"	0
therapist	2
Questions	1
questions	1
questions!	0
First	0
I	0
would	0
ask	0
them	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
experience	0
and	0
training	0
in	0
whatever	0
the	0
primary	0
issues	0
are	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
wanting	0
to	0
work	0
on	2
You	0
want	0
to	0
make	0
sure	0
the	0
therapist	0
has	0
the	0
skills	0
and	0
experience	0
to	0
help	0
you	2
It's	0
okay	0
to	0
ask	0
"have	0
you	0
worked	0
with	0
these	0
issues	0
before?"	0
and	0
"Can	0
you	0
tell	0
me	0
what	0
methods	0
you	0
use	0
to	0
treat	0
these	0
issues?"	0
and	0
"Are	0
the	0
methods	0
you	0
use	0
evidenced-based?"	0
Then	0
I	0
would	0
ask	0
what	0
expectations	0
the	0
therapist	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
of	0
you	0
the	0
client	2
Do	0
they	0
expect	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
homework	1
come	0
with	0
something	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
each	0
session	1
or	0
keep	0
a	0
journal	3
See	0
if	0
their	0
expectations	0
align	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
looking	0
for	2
And	0
lastly	1
I	0
would	0
schedule	0
a	0
session	0
and	0
"try	0
out"	0
the	0
therapist. 	0
See	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
and	0
safe. 	0
As	0
for	0
"training"	0
your	0
therapist	1
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
you	0
be	0
the	0
leader	0
of	0
your	0
therapy	1
ask	0
for	0
what	0
you	0
want	1
be	0
direct	0
and	0
do	0
hesitate	0
to	0
tell	0
your	0
therapist	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
getting	0
what	0
you	0
need	2
They	0
can't	0
read	0
your	0
mind	0
and	0
would	0
likely	0
find	0
that	0
information	0
very	0
valuable	2
They	0
want	0
you	0
to	0
feel	0
better	0
and	0
to	0
make	0
progress	1
and	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
going	0
down	0
the	0
wrong	0
path	0
you	0
should	0
let	0
them	0
know	2
Many	0
people	0
cry	0
during	0
their	0
therapy	0
sessions	2
Actually	0
most	0
people	0
cry	0
in	0
their	0
therapist's	0
office	2
I	0
tell	0
my	0
clients	0
that	0
it's	0
safe	0
to	0
cry	0
in	0
my	0
office	0
and	0
crying	0
isn't	0
a	0
sign	0
of	0
weakness	2
It's	0
a	0
normal	0
human	0
response	0
to	0
pain	2
People	0
actually	0
do	0
more	0
harm	0
to	0
themselves	0
by	0
trying	0
not	0
to	0
cry	0
than	0
by	0
crying	2
Crying	0
is	0
very	0
cleansing	0
and	0
an	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
healing	0
process	0
for	0
many	0
people	2
It	0
sounds	0
to	0
me	0

a	0

going	0
on	0

now	0
you	0

for	0
your	0

skills	2
We	0

what	0

we	0

all	0
of	0
yourself	0
tied	0
up	0
into	0
one	0
thing	0
(like	0

when	0
that	0

away	0
it	0

a	0
lot	0

Developing	0

what	0
it	0

at	0

there	0
are	0
two	0
kinds	0
of	0
household	0
environments	0
that	0
can	0
cause	0
dysfunction	0
in	0

One	0
is	0
when	0
you	0

up	0

a	0
very	0
rigid	0
stern	0
household	0

all	0
decisions	0

made	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
no	0
control	0
over	0
anything	2
The	0
other	0
is	0
a	0
household	0
where	0
things	0
were	0
chaotic	0
and	0
you	0
never	0
knew	0
what	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
happen	0
next	0

had	0
no	0
stability	2
People	0

to	0

emotionally	0

We	0
get	0
a	0

of	0
pressure	0
from	0
others	0

even	0
ourselves	0
to	0
define	0
who	0
we	0

what	0
we	0
want at	0
a	0
pretty	0
early	0
age	2
The	0
truth	0
is	1
our	0
sexuality	0
can change	0
and	0
grow	0
in	0
directions	0
we	0
never	0
imagined	2
I	0
may	0
be	0
wrong	1
but	0
I	0
am	0
getting	0
the	0
impression	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
gay	2
That	0
this	0
is	0
something	0
you	0
didn't	0

now	0
you	0
are	0

the	0
idea	0
that	0
it	0

This would	0
certainly	0
be understandable	2
Your	0
sexuality	0
is	0
YOURS	0

yours	0
alone	2
It	0
can	0
be	0
quite	0
frustrating	0

it	0

be	0
equally	0
frustrating	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
it	0
out	0
for	0
yourself	2
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
many	0
different	0
possibilities	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
sexual	0
orientation	2
It	0
may	0

If	0
you	0

what	0

about	0

is	0
also	0
a	0
difference	0
between	0
having	0
self-doubt	0
about	0
the	0
actual	0
physicality	0
of	0

about	0
whether	0

that	0

up	0
for	0

around	0

This	0

the	0

staying	0

for	0
some	0

after	0

idea	0
to	0

spending	0
time	0

the	0

is	0
to	0
learn	0
more	0

list	0
several	0
things	0
that	0

you	2
Even	0
if	0

how	0

these	0
are	0
some	0
of	0
the	0

difficult	0
for	0
you	0

out	0

that	0

to	0

how	0

for	0

Hello	2
Being	0
a	0
teenager	0
in	0
our	0
society	0
today	0
can	0
cause	0
depression	0
quite	0
easily	2
We	0
look	0
at	0
the	0
world	0
in	0
which	0
we	0
live	1
and	0
the	0
doubts	0
we	0
have	0
about	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
contribution	1
or	0
to	0
have	0
value	0
and	0
worth	0
with	0
the	0
people	0
around	0
us	1
and	0
we	0
begin	0
to	0
internalize	0
those	0
messages	0
of	0
self-worth	2
If	0
that	0
alone	0
were	0
not	0
enough	1
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
where	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
in	0
life	1
and	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
world	2
Teens	0
are	0
faced	0
with	0
pressures	0
of	0
being	0
judged	0
by	0
your	0
peers	0
for	0
how	0
you	0
present	0
yourself;	0
following	0
current	0
fashions;	0
possessing	0
the	0
trendy	0
things;	0
and	0
hanging	0
out	0
with	0
the	0
"in	0
crowd."	0
Here's	0
a	0
"secret"	0
that	0
might	0
help	0
with	0
most	0
of	0
those	0
issues:	0
Not	0
much	0
of	0
those	0
problems	0
I've	0
just	0
described	0
will	0
really	0
matter	0
as	0
they	0
might	0
seem	0
to	0
right	0
now	1
in	0
the	0
real	0
world	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
depression	0
because	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
lack	0
some	0
of	0
those	0
things	0
that	0
are	0
seen	0
as	0
important	0
by	0
others	0
(like	0
your	0
peers)	1
I	0
can	0
assure	0
you	0
that	0
being	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
kind;	0
compassionate;	0
understanding	0
of	0
another	0
person's	0
suffering;	0
and	0
the	0
effort	0
you	0
make	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
best	0
person	0
you	0
can	0
become	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
will	0
far	0
outweigh	0
anything	0
you	0
experienced	0
in	0
your	0
teen	0
years.When	0
we	0
are	0
young	1
we	0
judge	0
everything	0
based	0
on	0
what	0
our	0
peers	0
have	1
what	0
they	0
say	1
the	0
way	0
they	0
dress	1
who's	0
popular	1
who's	0
not	0
popular	1
and	0
for	0
the	0
most	0
of	0
it	1
all	0
of	0
that	0
is	0
external	2
So	0
the	0
question	0
becomes	1
are	0
you	0
trying	0
to	0
fix	0
the	0
feelings	0
on	0
the	0
inside	0
(the	0
internal	0
stuff)	1
with	0
the	0
trappings	0
of	0
all	0
the	0
stuff	0
on	0
the	0
outside	0
(the	0
internal)	3
That	0
is	0
to	0
say	1
do	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
had	0
what	0
your	0
friends	0
have	1
you	0
would	0
be	0
happy	0
and	0
less	0
depressed	3
Depression	0
is	0
usually	0
a	0
symptom	0
of	0
something	0
much	0
bigger	1
it	0
is	0
not	0
typically	0
a	0
problem	0
by	0
itself	0
(just	0
as	0
a	0
person	0
who	0
experiences	0
a	0
high	0
temperature	0
may	0
likely	0
have	0
a	0
cold)	2
So	0
fixing	0
the	0
symptom	0
requires	0
looking	0
at	0
the	0
possible	0
causes	2
In	0
your	0
post	1
you	0
mentioned	0
that	0
you	0
live	0
with	0
your	0
dad	2
Are	0
your	0
parents	0
divorced	0
or	0
separated	1
or	0
has	0
your	0
mom	0
passed	0
away	3
Either	0
of	0
these	0
circumstances	0
could	0
certainly	0
cause	0
depression	2
Finding	0
out	0
when	0
you	0
started	0
feeling	0
depressed	1
might	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
pinpoint	0
the	0
trigger	0
that	0
caused	0
it	1
which	0
requires	0
looking	0
at	0
when	0
you	0
last	0
felt	0

Hi	0
Smyrna,Your	0
husband	0
is	0
avoiding	0
dealing	0
with	0
this	0
problem	2
I	0
understand	0
how	0
lonely	0
you	0
must	0
feel	1
not	0
only	0
sexually	1
but	0
emotionally	0
too.From	0
what	0
you	0
describe	1
it	0
seems	0
that	0
he	0
wants	0
to be	0
there	0
for	0
you	1
but	0
he	0
clearly	0
has	0
barriers	0
to	0
engaging	0
fully	0
around	0
this	0
issue	2
My	0
hunch	0
is	0
that	0
he	0
doesn't	0
know	0
what	0
to	0
do	0
or	0
how	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
you	2
But	0
I	0
think	0
he	0
does	0
have	0
something	0
to	0
say.Your	0
husband	0
is	0
29	0
years	0
older	0
and	0
you've	0
been	0
together	0
for	0
ten	0
years...that	0
puts	0
you	0
at	0
around	0
thirty	0
perhaps	0
and	0
him	0
at	0
almost	0
sixty	3
Has	0
any	0
wise	0
older	0
woman	0
sat	0
you	0
down	0
to	0
explain	0
that	0
men	0
sometimes	0
have	0
erectile	0
issues	0
or	0
hormone-related	0
low	0
sex	0
drive	0
as	0
they	0
age	3
It's	0
possible	0
that	0
your	0
husband	0
is	0
bewildered	1
angry	1
grieving	0
or	0
anxious	0
about	0
changes	0
in	0
his	0
sex	0
drive	0
or	0
his	0
ability	0
to	0
maintain	0
an	0
erection	1
and	0
that	0
he	0
doesn't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
you	0
about	0
this	2
He	0
may	0
feel	0
like	0
he's	0
letting	0
you	0
down	1
and	0
he's	0
scared	0
it	0
will	0
get	0
worse	1
so	0
he's	0
sticking	0
his	0
head	0
in	0
the	0
sand	2
Of	0
course	1
that	0
doesn't	0
help	1
does	0
it?The	0
worst	0
case	0
scenario	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
get	0
angry	0
or	0
hopeless	1
that	0
he	0
senses	0
danger	0
or	0
disapproval	0
from	0
you	0
and	0
pulls	0
away	0
even	0
further	0
in	0
shame	2
Eventually	1
you	0
stop	0
chasing	0
him	1
and	0
you	0
drift	0
further	0
apart. It's	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
conundrum...how	0
to	0
honour	0
both	0
your	0
need	0
for	0
connection	0
and	0
honesty	0
and	0
his	0
need	0
for	0
a	0
safe	0
place	0
to	0
explore	0
his	0
fears	0
and	0
insecurities	2
Maybe	0
lower	0
your	0
expectations	0
for	0
a	0
bit	3
Your	0
husband	0
will	0
need	0
to	0
believe	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
a	0
safe	0
place	0
to	0
share	0
his	0
fears	1
and	0
you	0
would	0
need	0

the	0
fact	0
that	0
he's	0

for	0
your	0

(and	0

That's	0
a	0
great	0
first	0
step!	0
It's	0
also	0
good	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
identify	0
that	0
it's	0
not	0
always	0
a	0
physical	0
need	0
that's	0
driving	0
the	0
addiction.For	0
the	0
next	0
steps	1
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
when	0
the	0
psychological	0
cravings	0
for	0
a	0
cigarette	0
occur	2
The	0
psychological	0
(or	0
mental)	0
cravings	0
are	0
usually	0
based	0
out	0
of	0
habit	1
such	0
as	0
having	0
a	0
cigarette	0
after	0
a	0
meal	2
And	0
if	0
you're	0
consciously	0
trying	0
to	0
quit	1
you'll	0
find	0
the	0
craving	0
starts	0
with	0
simply	0
thinking	0
about	0
having	0
a	0
cigarette	1
then	0
usually	0
moves	0
on	0
to	0
thinking	0
about	0
how	0
good	0
it	0
made	0
you	0
feel	1
etc.	1
etc	2
Well	1
if	0
I'm	0
on	0
a	0
diet	0
and	0
I	0
continue	0
to	0
let	0
myself	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
ice	0
cream	0
sitting	0
in	0
the	0
freezer	1
eventually	0
I'll	0
give	0
in	0
and	0
eat	0
it.You're	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
thoughts	0
about	0
smoking	0
a	0
cigarette	2
That's	0
normal	0
and	1
for	0
the	0
most	0
part	1
out	0
of	0
your	0
control	2
But	0
you	0
choose	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
to	0
CONTINUE	0
thinking	0
and	0
dwelling	0
about	0
it	0
after	0
that	0
initial	0
thought	2
That's	0
what	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
changing	2
When	0
you	0
have	0
that	0
initial	0
thought	1
acknowledge	0
it	0
("Ok	1
I	0
kind	0
of	0
want	0
a	0
cigarette	0
now.")	1
but	0
then	0
change	0
the	0
thoughts	0
that	0
typically	0
follow	2
Distract	0
yourself	1
think	0
about	0
something	0
else	1
do	0
something	0
else	1
whatever	0
it	0
takes	0
to	0
get	0
your	0
mind	0
off	0
of	0
that	0
cigarette.I've	0
suggested	0
to	0
clients	0
before	0
that	0
they	0
should	0
plan	0
these	0
scenarios	0
out	0
ahead	0
of	0
time	0
so	0
they	0
already	0
know	0
what	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
when	0
the	0
time	0
comes	2
Write	0
down	0
when	0
you	0
usually	0
have	0
the	0
craving	0
for	0
a	0
cigarette	0
and	0
then	0
write	0
down	0
new	0
thoughts	0
or	0
things	0
to	0
do	0
to	0
get	0
your	0
mind	0
off	0
of	0
it	2
Eventually	1
it	0
will	0
become	0
easier	0
and	0
easier	0
to	0
brush	0
off	0
that	0
initial	0
thought	0
until	0
you	0
no	0
longer	0
have	0
it.Best	0
of	0
luck	1
and	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
really	0
great	0
motivator	0
to	0
quit	0

 Instead	0

the	0
way	0
they	0

the	0
stress	0
caused	0

dealing	0
with	0

with	0

 This	0
is	0
especially	0
important	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
had	0
more	0
than	0
one	0
negative	0
thing	0
happen	2
 Oftentimes	1
the	0
unconscious	0
reaction	0
is	0
to	0
become	0

and	0
avoid	0
all	0
feelings	1
especially	0
if	0
more	0
than	0
one	0
negative	0
event	0
occurred	2
 A	0
big	0
part	0
of	0
what	0
causes	0
people	0
trouble	0
are	0
feelings	0
of	0
guilt	2
 We	0
often	0
blame	0
ourselves	0
when	0
bad	0
things	0
happen	2
It	0
is	0
actually	0
difficult	0
to	0
comprehend	0
the	0
concept	0
that	0
we	0
don't	0
always	0
have	0
control	0
of	0
what	0
happens	0
in	0
life	2
 In	0
addition	1

it	0
sounded	0
like	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
your	0
reaction	0
is	0
wrong	2
 The	0
first	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
realize	0
that	0
your	0
feelings	0
and	0
reactions	0
are	0
o.k.	1
you	0
aren't	0
doing	0
anything	0
wrong	1
and	0
nothing	0
is	0
wrong	0
with	0
you	2
 The	0
next	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
start	0
dealing	0
with	0
the	0
impact	0
of	0
these	0
traumatic	0
experiences	2
Identifying	0
your	0
feelings	1
and	0
knowing	0
the	0
thoughts	0
and	0
beliefs	0
that	0
are	0
behind	0
those	0
emotions	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
regain	0
your	0
sense	0
of	0
happiness	2
 Research	0
shows	0
that	0
understanding	0
and	0
expressing	0
those	0
thoughts	0
and	0
feelings	0
can	0
help	2
 If	0
doesn't	0
sound	0
like	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
to	0
change	0
yourself	1
but	0
talking	0
to	0
a	0
counselor	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
in	0
managing	0
your	0
reaction	0
to	0
a	0
incredibly	0
traumatic	0

 I	0
hope	0
this	0

a	0
place	0

 	0
Finding	0
out	0
about	0
an	0
affair	0
is	0
quite	0
an	0
emotional	0
experience	2
It's	0
usually	0
jarring	2
I	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
give	0
yourself	0
some	0
compassion	0
about	0
emotions	0
that	0
you	0
have.You	0
asked	0
whether	0
it	0
is	0
possible	0
to	0
get	0
past	0
the	0
cheating	0
and	0
the	0
answer	0
is	0
that	0
it	0
can	0
be	2
It	0
depends	0
on	0
many	0
factors.I	0
would	0
recommend	0
that	0
you	0
see	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
couples	2
There	0
are	0
certain	0
ways	0
that	0
both	0
of	0
you	0
could	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
yourselves	0
and	0
each	0
other	0
that	0
may	0
actually	0
serve	0
to	0
make	0
your	0
relationship	0
stronger	2
Sometimes	0
there	0
are	0
motivations	0
for	0
having	0
an	0
affair	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
discussed	0
in	0
therapy	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
that	0
you	0
become	0
more	0
aware	0
of	0
what	0
each	0
other	0
is	0
experiencing	0
and	0
where	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
from	0
here	2
It	0
could	0
be	0
that	0
learning	0
to	0
communicate	0
differently	0
would	0
be	0
helpful.Regarding	0
whether	0
you	0
should	0
"just	0
move	0
on,"	0
I	0
recommend	0
talking	0
about	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
as	0
well	2
At	0
the	0
very	0
least	1
you	0
can	0
discuss	0
more	0

Hello	1

you	0

your	0
question	2
First	0
things	0
first	1
I	0
am	0
so	0
glad	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
alive	0
and	0
very	0
sorry	0
that	0
you	0
had	0
to	0
endure	0
such	0
a	0
terrible	0
experience	2
Now	1
let's	0
talk	0
about	0
these	0
nightmares	2
The	0
first	0
thing	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
NOT	0
losing	0
your	0
mind	2
Many	0
people	0
start	0
to	0
think	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
the	0
case	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
still	0
suffering	0
from	0
the	0
affects	0
of	0
something	0
that	0
happened	0
a	0
long	0
time	0

That's	0
not	0
the	0
case	2
There	0
is	0
no	0
time	0
set	0
time	0
for	0
which	0
we	0
should	0
be	0
"over"	0
something	0
like	0
this	2
I	0
am	0
not	0
sure	0
if	0
you	0
received	0
counseling	0
after	0
what	0
happened	0
to	0
you	1
but	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
to	0
consider	2
Bad	0
nightmares	0
could	0
be	0
the	0
sign	0
of	0
something	0
like	0
Post	0
Traumatic	0
Stress	0
Disorder	0
(PTSD)	1
which	0
would	0
include	0
other	0
symptoms	0
like	0
being	0
startled	0
easily	1
re-experiencing	0
the	0
event	1
or	0
avoiding	0
places	0
that	0
remind	0
you	0
of	0
it	2
There	0
are	0
other	0
symptoms	1
as	0
well	1
so	0
if	0
you	0
believe	0
this	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
you	0
have	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
seek	0
counseling	2
There	0
are	0
good	0
treatments	0
for	0
PTSD	2
If	0
you	0
cannot	0
seek	0
counseling at	0
this	0
time	1
there	0
are	0
some	0
things	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
manage	0
the	0
dreams	0
on	0
your	0
own	2
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
look	0
up	0
"sleepy	0
hygiene"	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
make	0
your	0
bedtime	0
rituals	0
as	0
relaxing	0
as	0
possible	2
You	0
can	0
also	0
Google	0
search	0
"Nightmare	0
re-scripting"	0
or	0
"Nightmare	0
Exposure"	0
and	0
get	0
some	0
ideas	0
on	0
how	0
you	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
change	0
your	0
dreams	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
attend	0
a	0
domestic	0
violence	0
support	0
group	0
and	0
get	0
ideas	0
from	0
other	0
survivors	0
who	0
no	0
doubt	0
have	0
had	0
sleep	0
problems	0
related	0
to	0
their	0

Feelings	0
of	0
anxiety	0
can	0
be	0
scary	0

sometimes	0
we're	0

should	0

be	0
worked	0
on	0
from	0
the	0
very	0
first	0
session	2
What	0
I	0
mean	0
by	0
that	0
is	1
there	0
should	0
be	0
an	0
understanding	0
that	0
the	0

do	0
together	0
will	0
have	0
an	0
ending	0

that	0
is	0
a	0

the	0

So	0
the	0
first	0

outlines	0
a	0

the	0

we	0
both	0
have	0
an	0
understanding	0
of	0

what	0

Now	0

the	0

ends	0

the	0

may	0
take	0
that	0
personally	1
it	0
is	0

are	0
some	0

out	0

Another	0
reason	0
a	0

that	0

When	0

I	0
usually	0
encourage	0

for	0

in	0
determining	0
what	0

behavior	0

Indeed	1
it	0
is	0
usually	0
when	0
our	0

conflict	0
with	0
our	0

that	0
we	0
don't	0
feel	0
very	0

Perhaps	0
you	0
can	0
take	0
some	0
time	0

through	0
a	0

questions:	0
What	0
kind	0
of	0

do	0
I	0

How	0
would	0

Let's	0

that	0
you	0

you	0

authentic	1
and	0
YOU	0
also	0
value authenticity as	0
something	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
live	0
by	2
You	0
may	0

currently	0
at	0

with	0
the	0

This	0
is	0
not	0
an	0
unusual	0
struggle	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
sexual	0
behavior	0
and	0
sexual	0
orientation	2
So	0
please	1
try	0
not	0
to	0
feel	0
alone	2
We	0
all	0

Thinking	0
about	0
your	0

For	0
example	1
someone	0
with	0
the	0

may	0
decide	0

what	0
they	0

That	0
may	0

Hi	2
I'm	0
glad	0
you	0
wrote	1

I	0
think	0
a	0

of	0
people	0
have	0
this	0

issue	0
(to	0
different	0
degrees)	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
talk	0
about	0
it	0
much	2
You	0
have	0
some	0
social	0
anxiety	0
that	0
is	0
a	0
bit	0
beyond	0
what	0
the	0
average	0

Most	0

have	0
some	0
amount	0
of	0
worry	0
about	0
what	0
others	0
might	0
think	0
of	0
them	1
and	0
this	0
probably	0
prevents	0
us	0
from	0
making	0
complete	0
fools	0
of	0
ourselves	0
so	0
that's	0
a	0
good	0
thing	2
But	0
your	0
"alarm	0

is	0
out	0

and	0
you	0
are	0
spending	0
too	0

As	0

and	0
it's	0
true...that	0
other	0

Like	0

people	1
you	0
lack	0
compassion	0
for	0
yourself	1
acceptance	0
of	0
yourself	0
and	0
confidence	0
in	0
yourself. My	0
gut	0
says	0
that	0
these	0
things	0
came	0
from	0
somewhere	0
in	0
your	0
past	2
Our	0
sensitivities	0
usually	0
come	0
from	0
(as	0
well	0
as	0
genetics)	0
a	0
specific	0
time	0
in	0
our	0
life	0
when	0
we	0

felt	0
something	0
that	0
was	0
overwhelming	0
and	0
we	0
end	0
up	0
with	0
an	0

times	2
Without	0

I	0
recommend	0
you	0

a	0
therapist	0

therapy	1

can	0

you	0

the	0

manage	0
them	0
more	0
successfully. 	0
First	0
of	0
all	1
if	0
you’re	0
sick	0
and	0
in	0

have	0
you	0
seen	0
your	0
doctor	3
If	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
chronic	0
illness	0
and	0
pain	1
this	0
can	0
often	0
lead	0
to	0
depression	0

is	0
very	0
common	2
You’ve	0
taken	0
the	0
first	0
step	0
to	0
dealing	0
with	0
it	2
You	0
can	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0
doctor	1
even	0
if	0
your	0
depression	0
isn’t	0
related	0
to	0

He	0

she	0
can	0
either	0
look	0
at	0
prescribing	0
you	0
an	0

can	0
refer	0
you	0
to	0
a	0
psychologist	0

that’s	0
not	0
really	0
an	0
option	0
for	0

there	0
are also	0

Hello	1

thank	0
you	0

your	0
question	2
It	0
certainly	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
don't	0
like	0
how	0
things	0
are	0
going	2
Here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
thoughts	0
and	0
ideas:1	2
If	0
you	0
haven't	0
seen	0
a	0
primary	0
care	0
provider	0
in	0
a	0
while	1
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	2
There	0
are	0
health	0
conditions	0
that	0
can	0
affect	0
your	0
mood	0
and	0
energy	0
levels	1
even	0
at	0
your	0
age	2
It	0
doesn't	0
hurt	0
to	0
get	0
checked	0
out	2
If	0
they	0
find	0
the	0
cause	1
they	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
treat	0
it	0
and	0
improve	0
the	0
symptoms	2
In	0
addition	1
most	0
primary	0
care	0
providers	0
are	0
trained	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
manage	0
medication	0
for	0
patients	0
who	0
have	0
mild	1
moderate	1
and	0
sometimes	0
severe	0
depression	2
So	1
don't	0
be	0
surprised	0
if	0
your	0
primary	0
care	0
doctor	0
offers	0
to	0
put	0
you	0
on	0
an	0
anti-depressant	0
if	0
they	0
diagnose	0
you	0
with	0
depression	2
Medication	0
is	0
not	0
the	0
only	0
way	0
to	0
treat	0
depression	1
but	0
sometimes	0
it	0
is	0
necessary	0
depending	0
on	0
different	0
factors.2	2
You	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
consider	0
counseling	1
since	0
it	0
is	0
another	0
effective	0
way	0
to	0
treat	0
depression	2
A	0
counselor	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
explore	0
the	0
factors	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
leading	0
to	0
depressive	0
symptoms	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	2
This	0
could	0
include	0
thoughts	1
behaviors	1
beliefs	1
life	0
experiences	1
and	0
other	0
things	2
3	2
Finally	1
to	0
answer	0
your	0
question	0
about	0
whether	0
these	0
feelings	0
are	0
"normal."	0
These	0
symptoms	0
could	0
be	0
the	0
sign	0
of	0
an	0
underlying	0
general	0
health	0
or	0

you	0

in	0
your	0

Sexual	0
intimacy	0
is	0
an	0

of	0
many	0
people's	0
life	1
but	0
how	0
much	0
importance	0
is	0
placed	0
on	0
it	0
varies	0
from	0
couple	0
to	0
couple. The	0
first	0
step	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
have	0
an	0
open	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0
husband	2
It's	0
important	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
open	0
about	0
what	0
you	0
desire	0
from	0
sexual	0
intimacy	0
and	0
how	0
much	0
intimacy	0
each	0
one	0
of	0
you	0
wants	2
For	0

asking	0
your	0

he	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
sex/	0
week	0

When	0
having	0
this	0

it's	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
respectful	0
and	0
open	0
with	0
each	0
other	2
The	0
point	0
of	0
the	0
conversation	0
is	0
to	0
get	0
to	0
know	0
each	0
other	0
and	0
not	0
to	0
solve	0
a	0
problem	1
yet. There	0
are	0
couples	0
who	0
enjoy	0
fulfilling	0
platonic/friendship	0
relationships	0
with	0
minimal	0

no	0
sex	0
because	0
both	0

If	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
on	0
the	0

lack	0
of	0
sex	0
might	0
not	0

a	0

there	0
is	0
a	0
difference	0
in	0
your	0
sex	0

Most	0

won't	0

Of	0

therapists	0
are	0
human	0

can	0
make	0
mistakes	1

I	0
find	0
it	0

that	0

something	0

There	0

You	0
will	0
notice	0
over	0

a	0

their	0
own	0
therapy!	0
It	0
sounds	0
to	0

anxious	0

be	0
perfect	0
and	0
has	0
a	0
low	0
tolerance	0
for	0

As	0
her	0
mother	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
messages	0
you	0
can	0
share	0
with	0
her	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
need	0
not	0

is	0
it	0
necessary. 	0
As	0
a	0
matter	0
of	0
fact	1
failure	0
and	0
making	0
mistakes	0
are	0
only	0
opportunity	0
to	0
learn	0
and	0
grow. 	0
Give	0
her	0
permission	0
and	0
more	0
importantly	0
she	0
needs	0
to	0
give	0
herself	0
permission	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
perfectly	0
flawed	0
human. 	0
It	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
see	0
a	0

help	0
her	0
learn	0
how	0
to	0

can	0
I	0
get	0
my	0

her	0
freaking	0
out?Communication	0

it	0
is	0
the	0
key	0
to	0
maintaining	0
a	0

functional	0
relationship	0
with	0
them	2
At	0
times	1
it	0
seems	0

with	0
our	0

because	0
many	0
feelings	0
and	0
“undercover”	0
messages	0
are	0
attached	2

with	0
our	0
mothers	1
who	0
often	0
provide	0
advice	0
and	0
feel	0
responsible	0
for	0
us	1
it	0

they	0
are	0
making	0
everything	0
about	0
themselves	0
as	0
they	0
express	0
their	0
worries	0

what	0
to	0
do	3
First	0
will	0
be	0
important	0
to	0
practice	0
active	0
listening	0
skills	1
to	0
ensure	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
receiving	0
and	0
understanding	0
the	0
message	1
without	0
filtering	0
it	0
trough	0
your	0
own	0
emotions	0
or	0
preconceptions	0
of	0
the	0
person	0
who	0
speaks	2
 Second	1
learn	0
and	0
practice	0
assertive	0
communication	0
skills. 	0
Those	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
communicate	0
a	0
message	0
clearly	0
and	0
in	0
pieces. 	0
It	0
also	0
emphasizes	0
using	0
I-statements	0
to	0
express	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
at	0
times	0
when	0
emotions	0
become	0
affected	0
by	0
the	0
interaction. 	0
Third	1
you	0
should	0
practice	1
by	0
writing	0
your	0
I-statement	0
or	0
role	0
playing	0
with	0
your	0
counselor	2
  The	0
trick	0
with	0
communication	0
skills	0
is	0
that	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
practice	0
them	0
as	0
often	0
as	0

the	0
beginning	0

to	0
get	0
to	0
your	0

question.	0
Can	0
a	0
relationship	0
move	0
past	0
infidelity	3
The	0
short	0
answer	0
is	0
yes	2
A	0
bit	0
longer	0
of	0
an	0
explanation	0
is	0
that	0
is	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
fiancé	0
had	0
pieces	0
of	0
a	0
solid	0
foundation	0
to	0
base	0
a	0
relationship	0
on	2
For	0
many	0
couples	0
they	0
encounter	0
a	0
primary	0
challenge	1
sometimes	0
that's	0
money	1
or	0
parenting	0
and	0
for	0
some	0
it's	0
sexuality	2
If	0
you	0
and	0
your	0

are	0
both	0
committed	0
to	0
balancing	0
the	0
positive	0
aspects	0
of	0
your	0

while	0
improving	0
the	0

than	0
it's	0
definitely	0
possible	0
to	0
move	0
past	0
this	2
This	0
is	0
not	0
an	0
easy	0
process	0
and	0
for	0
many	0
couples	0
takes	0
months	0
or	0
years	0
of	0
healing	0

Hello!	0
Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
I	0
have	0
a	0
worked	0
with	0
many	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
become	0
addicted	0
to	0
benzodiazepines	1
like	0
Clonazepam	2
It	0
is	0
a	0
difficult	0
road	0
for	0
people	0
who	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
become	0
clean	2
It	0
is	0
also	0
a	0
very	0
difficult	0
road	0
for	0
those	0
who	0
love	0
the	0
person	0
and	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
be	0
supportive	2
During	0
those	0
times	1
it	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	1
too	2
As	0
for	0
taking	0
your	0
friend's	0
pills	1
my	0
concern	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
legal	0
ramifications	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
face	0
should	0
you	0
ever	0
be	0
caught	0
with	0
someone	0
else's	0
prescription	0
medication	1
and	0
especially	0
these	0
types	0
of	0
medications	2
Our	0
laws	0
have	0
become	0
much	0
more	0
strict	0
surrounding	0
prescription	0
drug	0
sales	0
and	0
possession	0
due	0
to	0
the	0
increase	0
in	0
prescription	0
drug	0
abuse	2
In	0
addition	1
people	0
who	0
are	0
in	0
active	0
addiction	0
are	0
likely	0
to	0
find	0
some	0
other	0
means	0
to	0
get	0
their	0
drug	1
so	0
it	0
would	0
do	0
little	0
to	0
help	0
the	0
overall	0
problem	2
I	0
don't	0
know	0
about	0
your	0
friend's	0
family	0
situation	1
but	0
they	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
better	0
route	0
to	0
take	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
concerned	0
about	0
your	0
friend	2
They	0
may	0
already	0
be	0
involved	1
but	0
with	0
your	0
help you may be	0
able	0
to	0
convince	0
your	0
friend	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
treatment	0
willingly	2
That	0
is	0
usually	0
better	2
In	0
many	0
states	1
there	0
are	0
also	0
involuntary	0
committal	0
processes	0
where	0
a	0
person's	0
family	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
convince	0
a	0
court	0
to	0
force	0
the	0
person	0
into	0
treatment	2
This	0
varies	0
from	0
state	0
to	0
state	2
If	0
your	0
friend's	0
family	0
is	0
not	0
aware	0
of	0
this	0
option	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
to	0
look	0
into	2
It	0
usually	0
does	0
take	0
a	0
relative	1
or	0
a	0
medical	0
provider	1
to	0
begin	0
this	0
process	0
if	0
it	0

of	0

to	0
manage	0
anxiety	0

depression	0
symptoms	0
are	0
to	0
establish	0
a	0
good self-care routine. 	0
Start	0
with	0
the	0
most	0
basic	0
things:	0
Eating	0
balanced	0
meals	1
sleeping	0
at	0
from	0
6-8	0
hours	0
and	0
exercise	0
at	0
least	0
30	0
minutes	0
a	0
day. 	0
These	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
regulate	0
the	0
chemical	0
imbalance	0
that affects your	0
mood	1
plus	0
exercising	0
gives	0
you	0
time	0
to	0
vent	0
and	0
be	0
distracted	0
from	0
your	0
thoughts. 	0
Once	0
basic self-care is	0
established	1
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
to	0
start	0
exploring	0
the	0
source	0
of	0
these	0
feelings	1
and	0
address	0
them	0
trough	0
therapy. 	0
If	0
you	0
have	0
difficulty	0
initiating self-care routine	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0
therapist	0
about	0
what	0
motivates	0
you	0
and	0
pushes	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
things	1
you	0
might	0
find	0
the	0
key	0
during	0
the	0

Hello	1

thank	0
you	0
for	0
reaching	0
out	0

ask	0
for	0
help	2
Surely	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
confusing	0
time	0
for	0
you!	0
If	0
you	0
have	0
never	0

these	0

it	0
could	0
certainty	0
shake	0
everything	0
you	0
thought	0
you	0
knew	0
about	0
yourself	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
becoming	0
sick	0
around	0
the	0
time	0
that	0
this	0
started	0
is	0
likely	0
a	0
coincidence	1
but	0
I	0
understand	0
how	0
you	0
would	0
make	0
the	0
connection	2
I	0
have	0
a	0
feeling	0
that	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
may	0
be	0
going	0
on	0
here	2
It	0
is	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
say	0
since	0
I	0
don’t	0
know	0
you	1
how	0
old	0
you	0
are	1
etc	2
But	1
I	0
will	0
share	0
you	0
with	0
you	0
some	0
thoughts	2
Some	0
people	1
when	0
they	0
have	0
undesirable	0
thoughts	0
that	0
really	0
surprise	0
them	1
have	0
a	0
really	0
tough	0
time	0
getting	0
rid	0
of	0
them	2
Our	0
reaction	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
strong	0
and	0
our	0
tendency	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
block	0
it	0
out	1
stuff	0
it	1
avoid	0
it	1
etc	2
is	0
not	0
always	0
successful	2
In	0
fact	1
it’s	0
usually	0
not	2
It’s	0
like	0
telling	0
you	0
not	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
pink	0
elephants	2
I	0
would	0
be	0
willing	0
to	0
bet	0
that	0
you	0
thought	0
of	0
a	0
pink	0
elephant	0
just	0
now	2
So	1
rather	0
than	0
fighting	0
thoughts	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
confusing,	0
sometimes	0
it	0
is	0
helpful	0
to	0
allow	0

another	0
possibility	0

that	0

 It's	0
during	0

that	0

of	0
grief	2
This	0
includes	0
denial	1
anger	1
bargaining	1
depression	0
and	0
finally	0
acceptance. In	0
the	0
bereavement	0
process	1
there	0
is	0
so	0
specific	0
time	0
frame	0
or	0
lengths	0
of	0
time	0
for	0
someone	0
to	0
work	0
through	0
each	0

Its	0
imperative	0
to	0
note	0
 that	0
one	0
may express	0
each	0
stage	0
with	0
different	0
levels	0

Also	1
the	0
five	0

move	0
between	0
stages	0

achieving	0
a	0
more	0

Just	0
note	0
that	0
everyone	0
greives	0
differently	1
some	0
internalize	0
their	0
feelings	0
and	0
emotions	1
others	0
express	0
it	0
externally	1
while	0
other	0
avoid	0
it	0
all	0
together.Coping	0
with	0
loss	0
is	0
ultimately	0
a	0
deeply	0
personal	0
and	0
singular	0
experience	2
Sometimes	0
we	0
feel	0
that	0
no	0

what	0
we	0

is	0
that	0
you	0

stages	2
My	0
recommendation	0
is	0
to	0
allow	0

to	0
go	0
through	0
the	0
emotions	0

the	0
grief	2
