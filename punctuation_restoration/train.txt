Hello	1
It	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
good	0
when	0
it	0
seems	0
that	0
your	0
partner	0
no	0
longer	0
cares	0
or	0
cares	0
less	0
for	0
you	1
especially	0
if	0
your	0
feelings	0
have	0
not	0
changed	2
It	0
can	0
be	0
scary	1
frustrating	1
and	0
lonely	2
Have	0
you	0
tried	0
talking	0
to	0
him	0
about	0
your	0
concerns	3
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
to	0
start	0
there	2
There	0
may	0
be	0
several	0
reasons	0
for	0
his	0
actions	1
some	0
of	0
which	0
may	0
have	0
nothing	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
how	0
he	0
feels	0
for	0
you. Learning	0
about	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
on	0
for	0
him	0
will	0
likely	0
answer	0
your	0
questions	0
and	1
depending	0
on	0
his	0
response	1
may cause	0
some	0
relief	2
When initiating	0
conversations	0
about	0
subjects	0
that	0
are	0
sensitive	1
there	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
remember. Tell	0
him	0
how	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	1
rather	0
than	0
blaming	0
him	0
or	0
telling	0
him	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
doing	0
wrong	2
Avoid using	0
extreme	1
black	0
and	0
white	0
language	0
(i.e	2
always	0
and	0
never). For	0
example	1
you	0
may	0
say	0
something	0
such	0
as	1
"I	0
feel	0
confused	0
that	0
we	0
are	0
rarely	0
intimate	0
and	0
I'm	0
wondering	0
if	0
you've	0
also	0
noticed	0
this	0
change"	0
versus	0
"You	0
are	0
never	0
intimate	0
with	0
me	0
anymore." Don't	0
be	0
afraid	0
to	0
ask	0
him	0
questions	2
You	0
deserve	0
to	0
know	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
on	1
as	0
his	0
behavior	0
is	0
effecting	0
your	0
well	0
being	2
I	0
like	0
to	0
ask	0
open-ended	0
questions	0
instead	0
of	0
yes	0
and	0
no	0
questions	2
It	0
allows	0
for more	0
clarity	0
and	0
deeper explanation	2
Lastly, ask	0
yourself	0
(and	0
possibly	0
him)	0
what	0
part	0
you	0
play	0
in	0
the	0
recent	0
changes	2
Does	0
he	0
feel	0
that	0
you've	0
been	0
distant	3
Does	0
he	0
need	0
something	0
from	0
you	3
Let	0
him	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
willing	0
to	0
work	0
things	0
out	0
as	0
a	0
team	2
If	0
communication	0
attempts	0
fail	1
seeing	0
a	0
couple's	0
therapist	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
great	0
benefit	2
Having	0
an	0
objective	0

clearly	0

whether	1

how	1
to	0

the	0
other	0
person.These	0
discussions	0
stir	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
emotions	0
in	0
each	0
person	1
so	0
that	0
sometimes	0
staying	0
clear	0
minded	0
becomes	0
very	0
difficult	2
 You	0
both	0
will	0
likely	0
feel	0

talking	0
about	0

more	0
than	0
one	0

utilizing	0
a	0

luck	0
with	0

and	0

your	0

I	0
think	0
the	0
best	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
be	0
respectful	0
of	0
each	0
family	0
member's	0
wishes	2
Although	0
everyone	0
may	0
not	0
agree	0
with	0
one	0
another	1
the	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
each	0
other	0
is	0
to	0
respect	0
their	0
faith	0
and	0
beliefs	0
instead	0
of	0
trying	0
to	0
sway	0
them	0
in	0
a	0
certain	0
direction. There	0
are	0
many	0
families	0
that	0
are	0
united	0
despite	0
their	0
differences	2
For	0
example	1
a	0
mother	0
may	0
be	0
Catholic	0
and	0
the	0
father	0
Jewish	2
By	0
introducing	0
the	0
children	0
to	0
each	0
faith	0
until	0
they	0
are	0
ready	0
to	0
decide	0
for	0
themselves	0
can	0
be	0
beneficial. Also	1
it's	0
not	0
uncommon	0
for	0
views	0
to	0
change	0
as	0
one	0
ages	0
or	0
faces	0
different	0
life	0
experiences	2
So	0
don't	0
get	0
too	0
discouraged	0
if	0
your	0
child	0
wants	0
to	0
explore	0
different	0
avenues. Creating	0
a	0
loving	0
and	0
accepting	0
environment	0
is	0
most	0
essential. 	0
I	0
don't	0
think	0
it's	0
appropriate	0
to	0
give	0
your	0
counselor	0
a	0
bottle	0
of	0
wine	2
Your	0
counselor	0
helped	0
you	0
and	0
supported	0
you	1
which	0
is	0
great	1
But	0
a	0
gift	0
is	0
inappropriate	2
I	0
can	0
understand	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
show	0
your	0
gratitude	2
There	0
are	0
many	0
other	0
ways	0
to	0
do	0
that	2
You	0
could	0
drop	0
your	0
counselor	0
a	0
note	0
or	0
card	1
thank	0
him	0
in	0
person	1
or	0
tell	0
him	0
how	0
much	0
he	0
helped	0
you	2
These	0
small	0
gestures	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
meaningful	0
for	0
both	0
of	0
you	2
What	0
you	0
are	0
describing	0
is	0
something	0
I	0
often	0
refer	0
to	0
as	0
"living	0
with	0
your	0
roommate"	0
phenomenon	2
This	0
is	0
the	0
idea	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
living	0
with	0
a	0
roommate	0
and	0
no	0
your	0
partner	0
or	0
spouse	0
It	0
is	0
not	0
uncommon	0
for	0
members	0
of	0
a	0
couple	0
to	0
report	0
to	0
feel	0
both	0
physical	0
and/or	0
emotional	0
distance	2
When	0
we	0
don't	0
feel	0
connected	0
within	0
relationships	1
this	0
can	0
be	0
isolating	0
and	0
lonely	2
The	0
emotional	0
distance	0
often	0
makes	0
us	0
wonder:	0
am	0
I	0
important	0
to	0
the	0
other	3
These	0

Hi	0
Enid	1
You	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
sensitive	0
parent;	0
I	0
like	0
that	0
you	0
talked	0
to	0
your	0
son	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
anything	0
is	0
wrong	2
There	0
is	0
some	0
key	0
information	0
here	0
(I	0
don't	0
know	0
your	0
son's	0
age	1
whether	0
he	0
spent	0
any	0
money	1
whether	0
he	0
put	0
the	0
card	0
back	1
or	0
how	0
many	0
times	0
he's	0
stolen)	1
and	0
my	0
answer	0
might	0
be	0
different	0
depending	0
on	0
those	0
details	1
but	0
I'll	0
give	0
you	0
my	0
thoughts.I	0
see	0
it	0
as	0
every	0
child's	0
job	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
the	0
rules	0
and	0
find	0
where	0
their	0
power	0
is	0
in	0
the	0
world	2
In	0
order	0
to	0
accomplish	0
that	1
many	0
of	0
them	0
test	0
limits	2
"What	0
can	0
I	0
get	0
away	0
with?"	0
is	0
a	0
question	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
answer	0
to	2
If	0
a	0
child	0
knows	0
the	0
rules	1
they're	0
much	0
more	0
likely	0
to	0
not	0
test	0
limits	0
(because	0
they	0
already	0
know	0
the	0
limits)	2
So	1
part	0
of	0
testing	0
limits	0
is	0
experimenting	0
with	0
stealing	0
and	0
lying	2
Not	0
all	0
kids	0
steal	1
but	0
I	0
would	0
say	0
pretty	0
much	0
every	0
child	0
lies	0
at	0
some	0
point	2
It's	0
a	0
normal	0
behaviour	1
and	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
time	0
it's	0
about	0
small	0
things	0
that	0
don't	0
matter	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
even	0
find	0
out. Stealing	0
a	0
debit	0
card	0
is	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
serious	1
and	0
I'm	0
not	0
surprised	0
he	0
lied	0
about	0
it	2
If	0
you	0
absolutely	0
know	0
that	0
he	0
took	0
it	1
it's	0
okay	0
to	0
tell	0
him	0
that	0
you	0
believe	0
he	0
did	0
this	0
thing	0
and	0
also	0
lied	0
about	0
it	2
It's	0
appropriate	0
to	0
give	0
a	0
consequence	0
for	0
this	0
type	0
of	0
behaviour	1
so	0
that	0
the	0
child	0
doesn't	0
do	0
it	0
again	2
The	0
consequence	0
should	0
be	0
as	0
natural	0
and	0
logical	0
as	0
possible	2
The	0
behaviour	0
(stealing)	0
was	0
harmful	0
to	0
you	1
so	0
doing	0
you	0
a	0
favour	0
with	0
extra	0
chores	0
might	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea. It's	0
funny	1
because	0
as	0
parents	0
we	0
try	0
to	0
tell	0
our	0
kids	0
that	0
lying	0
is	0
bad	1
but	0
they	0
know	0
they'll	0
get	0
a	0
consequence	0
if	0
they	0
tell	0
the	0
truth	0
so	0
there	0
are	0
natural	0
deterrents	0
to	0
being	0
honest	0
(we	0
don't	0
want	0
people	0
to	0
know	0
our	0
mistakes)	2
It's	0
a	0
dilemma	2
If	0
you	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
the	0
lying	0
part	1
you	0
can	0
tell	0
him	0
that	0
you	0
won't	0
give	0
him	0
a	0
consequence	0
for	0
the	0
lying	0
if	0
he	0
decides	0
to	0
come	0
clean	0
with	0
the	0
truth	0
within	0
one	0
day	2
That	0
gives	0
him	0
incentive	0
to	0
come	0
to	0
you	0
with	0
truth	2
It	0
sometimes	0
works	0
with	0
kids	0
to	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	0
to	0
come	0
clean	0
and	0
then	0
reward	0
them	0
for	0
telling	0
the	0
truth. You	0
can	0
set	0
your	0
child	0
up	0
for	0
success	0
and	0
train	0
them	0
to	0
tolerate	0
honesty	2
Put	0
a	0
cookie	0
on	0
the	0
counter	2
Tell	0
your	0
child	0
to	0
take	0
the	0

at	0

Then	0

You're	0

there's	0

A	0

of	0

here:	0
1)	0
You	0

you	0

you	0

what	0
you	0

in	0

Becoming	0
a	0

a	0

Hello	2
That	0
must	0
be	0
very	0
frustrating	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
feel	0
that	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
reminded	0
of	0
constant	0
wrongdoing	0
in	0
your	0
relationship	1
especially	0
when	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
your	0
wife	0
does	0
not	0
admit	0
to	0
any	0
fault	2
This	0
could	0
lead	0
you	0
to	0
feel	0
inadequate	0
in	0
the	0
relationship	0
that	0
can	0
harm	0
your	0
relationship	0
in	0
the	0
long-term	2
Based	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
reporting	0
and	0
without	0
knowing	0
your	0
wife's	0
side	0
of	0
the	0
story	1
I	0
would	0
say	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
raising	0
3	0
different	0
concerns. One	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
concern	0
of	0
infidelity	0
from	0
your	0
wife	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
is	0
not	0
justified	2
It	0
may	0
bear	0
clarifying	0
how	0
each	0
of	0
you	0
define	0
"infidelity"	2
Currently	1
there	0
is	0
no	0
uniform	0
definition	0
of	0
infidelity	0
because	0
it	0
can	0
emcompass	0
a	0
hook-up	1
chatroom	0
texting	1
extensive	0
phone	0
calls	0
to	0
a	0
female	0
friend	1
viewing	0
pornography	1
a	0
massage	0
with	0
happy	0
ending	1
physical	0
intercourse	1
or	0
intimate	0
emotional	0
sharing	2
Depending	0
on	0
whether	0
any	0
of	0
these	0
circumstances	0
have	0
occured	1
you	0
may	0
need	0
to	0
reflect	0
whether	0
there	0
is	0
any	0
truth	0
to	0
what	0
she	0
may	0
be	0
accusing	0
you	0
of	0
and	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
share	0
with	0
her	0
your	0
reasons	0
for	0
engaging	0
in	0
these	0
activities	2
If	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
truth	0
to	0
it	1
then	0
my	0
clinical	0
intuition	0
is	0
that	0
she	0
may	0
be	0
accusing	0
you	0
of	0
infidelity	0
as	0
a	0
way	0
of	0
saying	1
"I	0
feel	0
you	0
distancing	0
from	0
me."	0
In	0
other	0
words	1
it's	0
not	0
so	0
much	0
about	0
whether	0
you	0
are	0
actually	0
unfaithful	0
but	0
a	0
statement	0
of	0
how	0
she	0
feels	0
as	0
she	0
witnesses	0
your	0
distancing	0
from	0
her	2
Often	0
times	1
accusing	0
a	0
partner	0
of	0
cheating	0
is	0
likened	0
to	0
a	0
cry	0
or	0
a	0
yearning	0
for	0
closeness	2
If	0
so	1
what	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
is	0
to	0
reflect	0
to	0
her	0
that	0
perhaps	0
she	0
is	0
saying	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
unfaithful	0
because	0
she	0
senses	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
moving	0
away	0
from	0
her	0
emotionally	2
If	0
this	0
is	0
true	1
you	0
may	0
wish	0
to	0
share	0
with	0
her	0
why	0
you	0
are	0
pulling	0
away	0
and	0
then	0
discuss	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
support	0
you	0
may	0
need	0
to	0
feel	0
closer	0
to	0
her	0
again	2
Otherwise	1
if	0
the	0
focus	0
becomes	0
about	0
who	0
is	0
right	0
and	0
who	0
is	0
wrong	1
the	0
conversation	0
will	0
never	0
touch	0
at	0
both	0
of	0
your	0
core	0
emotional	0
needs. The	0
second	0
issue	0
touches	0
upon	0
how	0
to	0
interpret	0
calling	0
someone	0
a	0
"sweetheart."	0
The	0
term	0
has	0
been	0
loosely	0
used	0
in	0
a	0
variety	0
of	0
contexts	0
to	0
mean	0
"you're	0
so	0
sweet	0

kind"	1
"my	0

in	0
a	0
flirtatious	0
manner	0

"sweetie."	0
The	0

You	0

the	0

it	0

what	0

said	2
 If	0

the	0

Hello	1

thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
Changing	0
unwanted	0
behavior	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
hardest	0
things	0
a	0
person	0
can	0
do	2
I	0
agree	0
with	0
Sherry	0
that	0
being	0
patient	0
with	0
yourself	0
is	0
important	2
Here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
I	0
would	0
suggest:1	2
Get	0
clear	0
on	0
the	0
behaviors	0
you	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
change	1
and	0
make	0
sure	0
they	0
are	0
behaviors	0
that	0
CAN	0
be	0
changed	2
Sometimes	0
we	0
will	0
set	0
a	0
goal	0
like	1
"I	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
confident"	0
but	0
that	0
is	0
hard	0
to	0
measure	0
and	0
prove	0
to	0
yourself	0
that	0
you	0
accomplished	0
it	2
Saying	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
accept	0
a	0
date	0
or	0
go	0
on	0
a	0
job	0
interview	0
is	0
something	0
you	0
can	0
actually	0
do	1
and	0
something	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
consider	0
to	0
be	0
demonstrating	0
confidence	2
Whatever	0
your	0
change	0
of	0
behavior	0
is	1
make	0
sure	0
it	0
is	0
something	0
you	0
can	0
actually	0
change	2
2	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
give	0
up	0
a	0
behavior	1
decide	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
in	0
place	0
of	0
it	2
So	1
if	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
stop	0
showing	0
up	0
late	0
for	0
work	1
then	0
you	0
are	0
deciding	0
to	0
be	0
on	0
time	0
for	0
work	0
and	0
demonstrating	0
your	0
value	0
of	0
being	0
punctual	2
3	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
make	0
changes	1
really	0
nail	0
down	0
WHY	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
make	0
them	2
What	0
is	0
it	0
about	0
making	0
these	0
changes	0
that	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
you	0
as	0
a	0
person	3
For	0
example	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
goal	0
of	0
weight	0
loss	1
the	0
reason	0
this	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
you	0
as	0
a	0
person	0
may	0
be	0
because	0
you	0
value	0
self-care	2
Knowing	0
WHY	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
make	0
changes	0
is	0
both	0
your	0
motivation	0
and	0
your	0
compass	0
for	0
getting	0
there	2
4	2
Once	0
you	0
know	0
WHY	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
make	0
these	0
changes	1
I	0
strongly	0
suggest	0
setting	0
small	0
goals	2
If	0
you	0
set	0
too	0
high	0
of	0
goals	0
you	0
may	0
not	0
accomplish	0
them	0
and	0
just	0
feel	0
worse	2
So	1
make	0
the	0
goal	0
small	1
realistic	1
and	0
guided	0
by	0
the	0
the	0
things	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
as	0
a	0
person	2

As	0
Sherry	0

finding	0
a	0
counselor	0
is	0
sometimes	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
feel	0
stuck	2
Any	0

who	0
does	0
work	0

help	2

It	0
sounds	0

if	0

professionals	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
discuss	0
some	0

said	0

I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0

consider	0
how	0
you	0

If	0

try	0
to	0
use	0
three	0
positive	0
ones	0
for	0

the	0

ones	2
You	0

try	0
asking	0
someone	0
who	0
you	0

to	0

you	0
with	0
the	0
list.The	0
idea	0
here	0
is	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
your	0
relationship	0
with	0
yourself	2
I	0
don't	0
mean	0
this	0

Hello	1

your	0
question	2
Nervousness	1
when	0
doing	0
something	0
new	1
especially	0
something	0
sexual	0
that	0
can	0
feel	0
so	0
personal	1
is	0
very	0
common	2
Indeed	1
despite	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
nervousness	0
can	0
be	0
uncomfortable	1
it	0
is	0
also	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
excitement	0
of	0
trying	0
something	0
new	2
Many	0
people	0
who	0
engage	0

tell	0
you	0
that	0
difficult	0
feelings	1
such	0
as	0
jealousy	0
and	0
anger	1
do	0
show	0
up	0
sometimes	2
This	0
doesn't	0
prove	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
something	0
wrong	0
with	0
the	0
relationship	1
it	0
just	0
shows	0
that	0
you	0
retain	0
normal	0
human	0
emotions	0
while	0
in	0
one	2
And	0
many	0
people	0
who	0
are	0

types	0
of	0

are	0
simply	0
not	0
an	0
exception	2
There	0
could	0
be	0
several	0
reasons	0
why	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
do	2
One	0
reason	0
could	0
be	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
simply	0
not	0
as	0
comfortable	0
with	0
the	0
idea	0
as	0
you	0
think	0
you	0
are	2
Some	0
time	0
and	0
good	0
communication	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
may	0
help	0
you	0
with	0
this	2
Another	0
reason	0
this	0
may	0
be	0
bothering	0
you	0
is	0
because	1
on	0
some	0
level	1
you	0
are	0
aware	0
of	0
the	0
messages	0
society	0
gives	0
us	0
about	0
marriages	2
They	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
monogamous	1
heterosexual	1
etc	2
etc	2
Just	0
because	0
you	0
may	0
not	0
agree	0
with	0
these	0
beliefs	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
that	0
you	0
haven't	0
been	0
influenced	0
by	0
them	2
We	0
all	0
have	2
Another	0
reason	0
this	0
may	0
be	0
upsetting	0
you	0
is	0
because	0
it	0
may	0
feel	0
a	0
little	0
frightening	2
Perhaps	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
"What	0

going	0
on	0
in	0
your	0
mind	2
When	0
you	0
get	0
the	0
"empty"	0
feeling	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
really	0
nail	0
down	0
the	0
emotions	0
that	0
are	0
attached	0
to	0
that	0
feeling	2
One	0
thing	0
that	0
I	0
do	0
think	0
is	0
very	0
important	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
communicate	0
these	0
feelings	0
to	0
your	0
husband	2
It	0
may	0
even	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
expectations	0
or	0
"ground	0
rules"	1
if	0
you	0
will	2
It	0
is	0

and	0
why	0

If	0
you	0
continue	0
to	0
struggle	1
I	0
suggest	0
finding	0
a	0

A	0
full	0

for	0
a	0
Major	0
Depressive	0
Disorder	0
i.e..	1
are	0

One	0
thing	0
I	0
often	0
tell	0

is	0
that	0
"Do	0
you	0

you	0
are	0
depressed?"	0
People	0
often	0
answer	0

if	0
I	0

stopped	0
enjoying	0

that	0
would	0
be	0
a	0

indication	0
for	0
me	0
that	0

It	0
would	0

sign	0
that	0

have	0
lost	0
pleasure	0
or	0
interest	0
in	0
the	0
activity	0
that	0
I	0
typically	0
enjoy	0
most	0
I'll	0
ask	0
you	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
one	0
activity	0
which	0
you	0
really	0
really	0
enjoy	2
 It	0
could	0
be	0
anything	0
from	0
reading	1
to	0
being	0
with	0
friends	1
to	0
skiing	0
to	0
watching	0

 I	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
now	0
ask	0
you	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
stopped	0
enjoying	0
that	0
activity	0
or	0
can't	0
find	0
the	0
motivation	0

This	0
is	0
another	0
symptom	0
of	0
depression:	0
loss	0
in	0
pleasurable	0
activities	2
The	0
good	0
news	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
many	0
effective	1
available	0
treatment	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
indeed	0
in	0
a	0
depression	0

to	0
modify/decrease	0
your	0

symptoms	0
i.e.	1
you	0

to	0

Treatment	0
includes	0
one	0
or	0
more	0
of	0
the	0
following:	0
psychotherapy	1
medication	1
exercise	2
Any	0
one	0
or	0
combination	0
of	0
both	0
of	0
these	0
can	0
help	0
to	0
improve	0
your	0
mood	2
The	0
even	0
better	0
news	0
is	0
that	0
feeling	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
doing	0
something	0
wrong	0
can	0
diminish	0
with	0
appropriate	0
treatment	0
over	0
time	2
 I	0
hope	0
you	0
find	0
this	0
information	0
helpful	2
The	0
most	0
important	0
next	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
get	0
evaluated	0
by	0
a	0
mental	0
health	0
professional	0
typically	0
a	0
psychologist	0
or	0
psychiatrist	1
and	0
for	0
both	0
you	0

the	0
professional	0
to	0
better	0

the	0
context	0

what	0
is	0
going	0

In	0

of	0

live	0
with	0
crumbling	0
of	0
our	0
values	0
which	0
then	0
gives	0
rise	0
to	0
insecurity	0
everywhere	2
 If	0
someone	0
doesn't	0
know	0
what	0
their	0
values	0
are	0
then	0
its	0
difficult	0
to	0
do	0
anything	1
and	0
right	0
now	0
everyday	0
we	0
hear	0
uncertainty	0
in	0
what	0
used	0
to	0
be	0

basic	0
assumptions.You're	0
more	0
normal	0
for	0

the	0

 This	0

may	0

may	0

when	0

There	0

a	0

a	0

Hello	2
Being	0
a	0
teenager	0
in	0
our	0
society	0
today	0
can	0
cause	0
depression	0
quite	0
easily	2
We	0
look	0
at	0
the	0
world	0
in	0
which	0
we	0
live	1
and	0
the	0
doubts	0
we	0
have	0
about	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
contribution	1
or	0
to	0
have	0
value	0
and	0
worth	0
with	0
the	0
people	0
around	0
us	1
and	0
we	0
begin	0
to	0
internalize	0
those	0
messages	0
of	0
self-worth	2
If	0
that	0
alone	0
were	0
not	0
enough	1
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
where	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
in	0
life	1
and	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
world	2
Teens	0
are	0
faced	0
with	0
pressures	0
of	0
being	0
judged	0
by	0
your	0
peers	0
for	0
how	0
you	0
present	0
yourself;	0
following	0
current	0
fashions;	0
possessing	0
the	0
trendy	0
things;	0
and	0
hanging	0
out	0
with	0
the	0
"in	0
crowd."	0
Here's	0
a	0
"secret"	0
that	0
might	0
help	0
with	0
most	0
of	0
those	0
issues:	0
Not	0
much	0
of	0
those	0
problems	0
I've	0
just	0
described	0
will	0
really	0
matter	0
as	0
they	0
might	0
seem	0
to	0
right	0
now	1
in	0
the	0
real	0
world	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
depression	0
because	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
lack	0
some	0
of	0
those	0
things	0
that	0
are	0
seen	0
as	0
important	0
by	0
others	0
(like	0
your	0
peers)	1
I	0
can	0
assure	0
you	0
that	0
being	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
kind;	0
compassionate;	0
understanding	0
of	0
another	0
person's	0
suffering;	0
and	0
the	0
effort	0
you	0
make	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
best	0
person	0
you	0
can	0
become	0
in	0
the	0
world	1
will	0
far	0
outweigh	0
anything	0
you	0
experienced	0
in	0
your	0
teen	0
years.When	0
we	0
are	0
young	1
we	0
judge	0
everything	0
based	0
on	0
what	0
our	0
peers	0
have	1
what	0
they	0
say	1
the	0
way	0
they	0
dress	1
who's	0
popular	1
who's	0
not	0
popular	1
and	0
for	0
the	0
most	0
of	0
it	1
all	0
of	0
that	0
is	0
external	2
So	0
the	0
question	0

One	0
of	0
the	0
sometimes	0
difficult	0
things	0
about	0

the	0

you	0
can't	0

you	0
can	0

you	0
can't	0
independently	0
make	0
it	0
happen.I	0
wonder	0
if	0
both	0
of	0
you	0
would	0
be	0
willing	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
discussion	0
where	0
he	0
is	0
able	0
to	0
explain	0
to	0
you	0
what	0

and	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
listen	0
for	0
five	1
10	1
15	0
minutes	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
that	0
is	0
not	0
blaming	0
or	0
pointing	0
fingers	0
or	0
asking	0
him	0
to	0
change	1
but	0
just	0
listening	0
(kind	0
of	0
like	0
an	0
investigative	0
reporter)	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
have	0
more	0
details	0
and	0
ask	0
questions	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
about	0
what	0
certain	0

mean	1
when	0
it	0
feels	0

to	0
to	0
him	0
when	0
this	0
is	0
discussed	1
etc	2
At	0
that	0
point	1
maybe	0
he	0
would	0
willing	0
to	0
listen	0
to	0
your	0
thoughts	0
on	0
the	0
subject	0
as	0
well.Also	1
if	0
he	0
wants	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
change	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
couples	2
Sometimes	0
changes	0
such	0
as	0
these	0
require	0
a	0
great	0
deal	0
of	0
personal	0
awareness	0
and	0
there	0
can	0
be	0
quite	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
emotions	0
attached	1
so	0
it	0
is	0
often	0
helpful	0
to	0
have	0
someone	0
there	0
to	0
assist.It	0
may	0
also	0
be	0
nice	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
discussion	0
where	0
you	0
consider	0
what	0
makes	0
you	0
feel	0
valued	1
appreciated	1
special	1

loved	1
and	0
also	0
consider	0
what	0
makes	0
your	0

feel	0
that	0
way	2
It	0
certainly	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
some	0
anxiety	2
Before	0
deciding	0
whether	0
it	0
was	0
social	0
anxiety	0
or	0
a	0
more	0
general	0
type	0
of	0
anxiety	1
I	0
would	0
wonder	0
what	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
think	0
will	0
result	0
from	0
you	0
raising	0
your	0
hand	0
or	0
talking	0
to	0
someone	0
you	0
don't	0
know	2
Here	0
is	0
some	0
information	0
on	0
social	0
anxiety: https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/what-is-social-anxietyI	0
would	0
recommend	0
talking	0
to	0
a	0
local	0
mental	0
health	0
professional	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
your	0
anxiety	0
is	0
affecting	0
your	0
daily	0
life	0
and	0
there	0
are	0
lots	0
of	0
strategies	0
that	0
may	0
help	0
to	0
lessen	0
that.Thanks	0
for	0
being	0
brave	0
to	0
post	0
here	2
I	0
recommend	0
that	0
you	0
focus	0
on	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
or	0
irrational	0
beliefs	0
that	0
are	0
going	0
through	0
your	0
mind	0
at	0
the	0
time	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
approach	0
a	0
girl	2
When	0
you	0
are	0
aware	0
of	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
or	0
irrational	0
beliefs	1
you	0
can	0
then	0
work	0
on	0
changing	0
them	2
An	0
easy	0
way	0
to	0
recognize	0
an	0
irrational	0
belief	0
is	0
a	0
thought	0
that	0
contains	0
the	0
words	0
"must	0
or	0
never."	0
Once	0
you	0
recognize	0
the	0
thought	0
or	0
belief	1
I	0
would	0
like	0
you	0
to	0
picture	0
a	0
big	0
red	0
stop	0
sign	2
This	0
is	0
called	0
thought	0
stopping	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
technique	0
to	0
use	0
to	0
stop	0
unwanted	0
or	0
unhealthy	0
thoughts	2
Then	1
I	0
would	0
like	0
you	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
a	0
more	0
positive	0
thought	0
to	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
such	0
as:	0
Negative	0
thought:	0
"That	0
girl	0
will	0
never	0
go	0
out	0
with	0
me"	0
STOP	0
Positive	0
thought:	0
"I	0
won't	0
know	0
if	0
she	0
will	0
go	0
out	0
with	0
me	0
unless	0
I	0
ask"	2
What	0
this	0
does	0
is	0
increase	0
your	0
self	0
confidence	0
by	0
replacing	0
your	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
with	0
positive	0
ones	0
that	0
will	0
ultimately	0
boost	0
your	0
self	0
esteem	2
Your	0
question	0
is	0
actually	0
thoughtful	0
and	0
reflects	0
a	0
true	0
interest	0
to	0
know	0
more	0
about	0
life.No	0
one	0
knows	0
if	0
god	0
is	0
a	0
lie	0
because	0
"god"	0
is	0
a	0
concept	0
in	0
which	0
people	0
either	0
make	0
up	0
their	0
own	0

of	0
this	0

of	0
the	0

provable. 	0
From	0
what	0
you	0
describe	0
about	0
yourself	1
I	0
agree	0
with	0
you	0
that	0
ending	0
your	0
former	0
relationship	0
was	0
a	0
very	0
wise	0
decision.The	0
nightmares	0
and	0

show	0
that	0
you	0
were	0
deeply	0
affected	0
emotionally	0
and	0
on	0
the	0
foundations	0
of	0
your	0
basic	0
nature.The	0
way	0
for	0
these	0
to	0
stop	0
is	0
by	0
the	0
slow	0
process	0
of	0
realizing	0
how	0
badly	0
injured	0
and	0
frightened	0
you	0
were	0
of	0
your	0
former	0
partner.Once	0
you've	0
stabilized	0
yourself	0
by	0
accepting	0
the	0
tremendous	0
harshness	0
that	0
was	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
former	0
relationship	1
then	0
the	0
nightmares	0
and	0

will	0
disappear	0
gradually	0
usually	1
maybe	0
all	0
at	0
once.There	0
is	0
a	0
possibility	0
too	0
that	0
your	0
former	0
relationship	0
connected	0

being	0
emotionally	0
ignored	1
abandoned	1
treated	0
harshly	0
during	0
your	0
time	0

generally	0

relate	0
similarly	0
to	0
the	0
ways	0
in	0
which	0
they	0
felt	0
treated	0
by	0

it	0

that	0
you	0

very	0
young	2
 When	0
young	0
children	0
hear	0
negative	0
things	0
about	0
themselves	0
they	0
tend	0
to	0
internalize	0
these	0
negative	0
ideas	0

to	0
form	0
negative	0
core	0

 The	0
good	0
news	0
is	0
we	0
can	0
learn	0
to	0
stop	0
these	0
thoughts	0
and	0
to	0
replace	0
them	0
with	0
healthier	0
thoughts	2
 The	0
first	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
catch	0
yourself	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
thinking	0
these	0
thoughts	1
and	0
to	0
stay	0
"stop!";	0
then	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
another	0
thought	2
 So	0
for	0
instance	1
maybe	0
you	0
fail	0
a	0
test	0
or	0
get	0
rejected	0
by	0
a	0
romantic	0
interest	2
 You	0
catch	0
yourself	0
saying	0
"you	0
aren't	0
worth	0
anything"	2
Stop	0
this	0
thought	1
and	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
"You	0
didn't	0
do	0
as	0
well	0
on	0
that	0
test	0
as	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
liked	2
 Let's	0
figure	0
out	0
how	0
you	0

 Or	0
"she	0
may	0
not	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
out	0
with	0
you	1
but	0
someone	0

So	0
the	0
idea	0
is	0
to	0
develop	0
a	0
voice	0
of	0
a	0
"friend"	1
who	0
can	0
tell	0

Hi	0
there, There	0
are	0
a	0
number	0
of	0
reasons	0
why	0
a	0
therapeutic	0
relationship	0
might	0
end	0
including	1
but	0
not	0
limited	0
to	0
the	0
client	0
reaching	0
their	0
goals	1
the	0
client	0
reaching	0
a	0
place	0
of	0
acceptance	0
where	0
they	0
wish	0
to	0
remain	0
or	0
even	0
a	0
breach	0
within	0
the	0
relationship	2
 The	0
last	0
aspect	0
should	0
likely	0
be	0
taken	0
to	0
supervision	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
be	0
fully	0
processed	2
 All	0
of	0
these	0
things	0
could	0
happen	1
and	0
usually	0
happen	0
organically	0
(again	1
except	0
for	0
the	0
last	0
example). Your	0
question	1
however	1
was	0
about	0
the	0
counselor	0
ending	0
treatment	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
difficult	0
and	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
nerve-wracking	2
 It	0
may	0
be	0
beneficial	0
to	0
take	0
this	0
with	0
you	0
to	0
supervision	1
as	0
well	2
 It's	0

to	0

why	0
you	0
feel	0
the	0
need	0
to	0
end	0
or	0

with	0
the	0
client	1
as	0

Do	0
you	0

that	0
they	0

for	0
another	0
therapist	1

their	0

it	0
something	0

point	0
of	0
checking	0
in	0
with	0
the	0
clients	0
fairly	0
frequently	2
In	0
these	0
check-ins	1
I	0
use	0
the	0
time	0

ask	0
the	0
client	0
how	0

about	0
the	0
sessions	0
and	0
if	0
there	0
is	0
anything	0

astutely	2

any	0
immediate	0
goals	0
that	0
they	0

 In	0

remain	0

and	1
should	0
they	0
wish	0
to	0
shift	0
their	0
focus	1
that	0
they	0
recognize	0
it	0
is	0
part	0
of	0
my	0
responsibilities	0
to	0
make	0
sure	0
we	0
move	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
desired	0
goal. Often	1
especially	0
in	0
longer	0
term	0
therapeutic	0
relationships	1
we	0
as	0
clinicians	0
can	0
see	0
that	0
the	0
client	0
has	0
reached	0
their	0
goal	1
however	0
they	0
are	0
apprehensive	0
about	0
ending	0
therapy	2
 This	0
is	0
actually	0
a	0
great	0
place	0
to	0
go	0
with	0
them;	0
why	0
would	0
they	0
feel	0
unable	0

handle	0
issues	0

their	0
external	0

internal	0
environment	0
without	0

Often	1
having	0
this	0
open	0
discussion	0
can	0
increase	0
empowerment	0

mastery	2
That	0
said	1
it	0

highlight	0

issues	0
which	0
the	0

may	0

about	0
going	0
into	0
within	0
therapy	0
and	0
now	1
as	0
the	0
relationship	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0

more	0

in	0
bringing	0
these	0
up. In	0
the	0
case	0
where	0
the	0
relationship	0
is	0
a	0
toxic	0
one	1
terminating	0
with	0
a	0
client	0
may	0
be	0
the	0
best	0
option	0
for	0
both	0
of	0
you	2
It's	0
a	0
difficult	0
conversation	1
but	0
recall	0
that	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
role	0
of	0
the	0
therapist	0
is	0
to	0
model	0
that	0
these	0
discomforts	0
can	0
be	0
managed. I	0
hope	0
that	0
this	0

you	0

forward!	0
 	0
As	0

the	0
impact	0
will	0
not	0
just	0
"go	0
away"	2
Treatment	0
of	0
trauma	0
is	0
like	0
surgery	1
it	0
requires	0
a	0
skillful	0
clinician	0
to	0
help	0
resolve	0
it	2
While	0
you	0
are	0
contemplating	0
getting	0
help	1
you	0
can	0
focus	0
on	0
calming	0
techniques	0

meditation	0
and	0
yoga	2
They	0
will	0
aid	0
you	0
when	0
you	0

the	0
therapeutic	0
process	2
This	0

more	0

It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
may	0
be	0
asking	0
two	0

questions.With	0

what	0
you	0

about	0
your	0
husband	0
dressing	0
as	0
a	0
female	0
in	0
your	0

I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0
would	0
consider	0
asking	0
him	0
more	0
about	0
this	2
If	0
you	0
choose	0
to	0
do	0
that	1
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
ask	0
him	0
whether	0
a	0
certain	0
time	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
conversation	0
and	0
asking	0
questions	0
for	0
five	0
minutes	0
or	0
more	0
that	0
are	0
related	0
to	0
you	0
learning	0
more	0
about	0
his	0
experience	2
This	0
can	0
be	0
difficult	0
to	0
do	0
at	0
times	1
particularly	0
when	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
offer	0
your	0
own	0
opinions	0
or	0
become	0
very	0
anxious	0
or	0
of	0
type	2
Consider	0
thinking	0
of	0
a	0
phrase	0
that	0
may	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
stay	0
calm	0
during	0
the	0
discussion	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
yourself	0
as	0
asking	0
questions	0
as	0
if	0
you	0
were	0
an	0
investigative	0
reporter	0
and	0
using	0
questions	0
that	0
start	0
with	0
words	0
like	0
"what	1
how	1
who	1
where	1
when."	0
Questions	0
that	0
start	0
with	0
"why,"	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
difficult	0
to	0
answer	0
for	0
some	0
people	0
and	0
can	0
be	0
overwhelming	0
because	0
it	0
often	0
links	0
to	0
answers	0
involving	0
emotions	0
that	0
may	0
or	0
may	0
not	0
be	0
understood. Also	0
try	0
restating	0
what	0
your	0
husband	0
is	0
saying	0
to	0
make	0
sure	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
understanding	0
correctly	2
If	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
telling	0
you	0
is	0
different	0
than	0
what	0
you	0
have	0
heard	0
or	0
thought	0
of	0
for	0
many	0
years	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
challenging	0
to	0
follow	0
his	0
meaning	0
initially	2
Remember	0
that	0
listening	0
to	0
your	0
husband	0
does	0
not	0
imply	0
agreement	0
with	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
saying	1
just	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
following	0
and	0
looking	0
to	0
understand	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
experiencing	2
I	0
also	0
recommend	0
sticking	0
to	0
one	0
topic	0
for	0
the	0
conversation	1
but	0
this	0
could	0
be	0
done	0
with	0
many	0
different	0
topics	0
over	0
time.You	0
could	0
also	0
see	0
if	0
he	0
would	0
be	0
willing	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
discussion	0
where	0
he	0
listens	0
like	0
an	0
investigative	0
reporter	0
to	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
the	0
experience	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
having.As	0
far	0
as	0
what	0
you	0
mentioned	0
about	0
the	0
sexual	0
experience	1
maybe	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
discuss	0
what	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
don't	0
like	0
and/or	0
understand	0
what	0
it	0
is	0
that	0
he	0
does	0
like	1
you	0
could	0
see	0
if	0
there	0
is	0
some	0
middle	0
ground	0
here	2
It	0
depends	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
both	0
prefer.These	0
types	0
of	0
conversations	0
can	0
be	0
difficult	0
to	0
have	0
for	0
some	0
couples	1
at	0
least	0
initially	2
Having	0
structured	0
conversations	1
such	0
as	0
the	0
ones	0
I've	0
described	0
briefly	0
above	1
can	0
feel	0
awkward	0
initially	1
but	0
the	0
reason	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
is	0
because	0
it	0
can	0
lead	0
to	0
further	0
understanding	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
that	0
decreases	0
the	0
chances	0
of	0
having	0
an	0
argument.Also	0
consider	0
seeing	0
a	0
therapist	0
in	0
your	0
area	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
couples	0
to	0
discuss	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
ideas	2
One	0
key	0
factor	0
to	0
consider	0
is	1
are	0
you	0
able	0
to	0
repair	0
after	0
your	0
arguments	3
It	0
seems	0
from	0
your	0
question	0
that	0
repair	0
is	0
lacking	0
after	0
any	0
disagreement	0
or	0
argument	2
When	0
couples	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
repair	0
after	0
an	0
argument	1
they	0
have	0
an	0
opportunity	0
to	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
each	0
other's	0
needs	0
moving	0
forward. I'm	0
also	0
curious	0
if	0
you're	0
having	0
the	0
same	0
type	0
of	0
arguments	0
over	0
and	0
over	3
If	0
you're	0
stuck	0
in	0
a	0
particular	0
pattern	1
and	0
can	0
start	0
recognizing	0
what	0
happens	0
between	0
you	0
when	0
this	0
pattern	0
happens	1
then	0
you	0
can	0
start	0
to	0
name	0
it	2
Once	0
you	0
name	0
it	1
then	0
you	0
can	0
take	0
a	0
break	0
to	0
cool	0
off	0
and	0
come	0
back	0
to	0
each	0
after	0
your	0
nervous	0
system	0
has	0
had	0
a	0
chance	0
to	0
calm	0
down	0
(about	0
30	0
minutes)	2
The	0
key	0
here	0
though	0
is	0
to	0
make	0
sure	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
plan	0
in	0
place	0
-	0
when	0
things	0
are	0
good	0
between	0
you	0
-	0
an	0
agreement	0
between	0
you	0
that	0
when	0
you	0
both	0
start	0
to	0
get	0
escalated	1
you'll	0
name	0
it	0
or	0
have	0
an	0
agreed	0
upon	0
code	0
word	0
to	0
signal	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
continue	0
this	0
cycle	1

then	0
agree	0
to	0
cool	0
off	0
and	0
come	0
back	0
together	0
at	0
a	0
later	0
time	2
That	0
way	1
when	0
this	0
is	0
enacted	0
during	0
an	0
argument	1
nobody	0
feels	0
abandoned	0
during	0
the	0
cool	0
off	0
time	2
Rather	1
both	0
partners	0
know	0
they	0

return	0
at	0
a	0
time	0
when	0

can	0
truly	0

is	0
such	0
a	0
personal	0
process	0
and	0
often	0
brings	0
many	0
emotions	0
to	0
the	0
forefront	1
so	0
yes	1
it	0
very	0
normal	0
to	0
cry	0
in	0
therapy. 	0
Often	0
you	0

talking	0
about	0

Therapy	0

are	0
effective	0

the	0

some	0
of	0
the	0

This	0
isn't	0
always	0
easy	0
to	0
do	1
but	0
it	0
sure	0
is	0
important	0
if	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
see	0
improvement	2
It	0
does	0
sound	0
cliche	1

communication	0
really	0
is	0
the	0
bedrock	0
of	0

relationships	1
but	0
really	0
any	0
relationship	0
that	0
is	0
significant	0
to	0
us	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
saying	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
difficult	0
time	0
really	0
listening	0
to	0
what	0
your	0

Hi	0
Dillon,I'm	0
from	0
Canada	1
so	0
I	0
don't	0
know	0
the	0
laws	0
in	0
your	0
state	2
It	0
depends	0
on	0
that	0
a	0
good	0
deal	1
perhaps. In	0
my	0
opinion	1
a	0
child	0
should	0
never	0
be	0
forced	0
into	0
a	0
situation	0
where	0
they	0
feel	0
unsafe	1
even	0
if	0
it	0
is	0
"supervised"	2
If	0
the	0
child	0
is	0
old	0
enough	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
strong	0
statement	0
about	0
not	0
wanting	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
parent	1
then	0
this	0
should	0
be	0
honoured. Unfortunately	1
the	0
laws	0
don't	0
always	0
uphold	0
a	0
parent's	0
right	0
to	0
do	0
what	0
is	0
best	0
for	0
their	0
child	2
I	0
recommend	0
you	0
see	0
a	0
lawyer	1
who	0
will	0
advise	0
you	0
about	0
how	0
to	0
proceed	0
without	0
putting	0
yourself	0
at	0
risk	0
of	0
breaching	0
custody	0
agreements.If	0
you	0
feel	0
your	0
daughter	0
can	0
benefit	0
from	0
therapy	1
that	0
is	0
a	0
separate	0
question	2
Or	0
is	0
she	0
already	0
in	0
therapy	3
A	0
family	0
therapist	0
will	0
typically	0
meet	0
with	0
you	0
alone	0
first	1
in	0
order	0
to	0
determine	0
if	0
therapy	0
is	0
a	0
wise	0
move	0
for	0
your	0
child	2
It	0
isn't	0
always	0
appropriate. 	0
One	0
choice	0
is	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
wife	0
to	0
decide	0
together	0
what	0
are	0
reasonable	0
ways	0
and	0
expectations	0
to	0
have	0
of	0
your	0
mother.From	0
what	0
you	0
write	0
it	0

your	0

and	0
you	0
have	0
differences	0
as	0
to	0
what	0
is	0
the	0
proper	0
and	0
right	0
way	0
to	0
talk	0
with	0
your	0

the	0

of	0
you	0
agree	0
on	0
overall	0
philosophy	0
and	0
some	0
specific	0
details	0
for	0

then	0
ask	0
your	0
mother	0
to	0
make	0
time	0
for	0
all	0
three	0
of	0
you	0
to	0
discuss	0
together	0
the	0
expectations	0

standards	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
wife	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
see	0
happen.This	0

only	0
the	0
first	0
step	0
since	0
it	0
is	0
possible	0
and	0
likely	0
that	0
at	0
least	0
on	0
a	0
few	0
points	1
your	0
mother	0
will	0
disagree	0
and	0
have	0
different	0
views.These	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
discussed	0
and	0
integrated	0
into	0
an	0
overall	0
plan	0

all	0
three	0
of	0

that	0
you	0

your	0
friend	2
I’m	0
sure	0
this	0
is	0
all	0
overwhelming	0
and	0
frustrating	0
for	0
you	2
The	0
biggest	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
your	0
friend	0
is	0
to	0
be	0
supportive	0
as	0
you	0

Unfortunately	0
there	0
isn’t	0
much	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
her	0
outside	0
of	0
that	0
because	0
it	0
is	0
up	0
to	0
her	0
husband	0
to	0
change	0
and	0
up	0
to	0
your	0
friend	0
if	0
she	0

There	0
are	0
things	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
to	0
support	0
more:	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
helpful	0
for	0
her	0
to	0
have	0
some	0
information	0
on	0
a	0
domestic	0
violence	0
non	0
profit	0
in	0
her	0
area	0
because	0
they	0
can	0
assist	0
her	0
in	0
many	0
areas	0
if	0
she	0
wants	0
to	0
leave	2
They	0
can	0
also	0
provide	0
you	0
with	0
support	0
while	0
you	0
go	0
through	0
this	0
with	0
her	2
The	0
nonprofit	0
can	0
also	0
safety	0

with	0
her	0

it	0
might	0
be	0
helpful	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
it	0
with	0
her	0
if	0
you	0
want	0
to	2
Another	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
support	0
her	0
in	0
decision	0
to	0
stay	0
with	0
her	0
husband	0
or	0
not	0
despite	0
what	0
she	0
decides	2
Many	0
victims	0
decide	0
to	0
stay	0
with	0
thier	0
abusive	0
partner	0
for	0
many	0
reasons	2
It	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
support	0
her	0
decisions	1
even	0
if	0
you	0
don’t	0
agree	0
with	0
them	1
because	0
she	0
may	0
have	0
very	0
little	0
decision	0
making	0
in	0
her	0
relationship	2
I	0
would	0
also	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
make	0
sure	0
you	0
are	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0
while	0
you	0
support	0
her	0
so	0
you	0
are	0
not	0

too	0

"Normal"	0
can	0
be	0
an	0
insidious	0
word	0
to	0
use	0
because	0
it	0
can	0
undermine	0
your	0
sense	0
of	0
worth	2
 It	0
implies	0
there's	0
one	0
particular	0
way	0
you	0
should	0
be	0
behaving	0
and	0
can	0
leave	0
you	0

"abnormal"	0
if	0
you're	0
not	0
behaving	0
according	0
to	0
that	0
prescribed	0
standard	2
 Instead	1
what	0
I'd	0
recommend	0
is	0
to	0
pay	0
attention	0
to	0
your	0
emotional	0
experiences	0
when	0
you're	0
attending	0
therapy	2
 Explore	0
your	0

thoughts	0
without	0
judgement	0

try	0
to	0
reflect	0
and	0
understand	0
what's	0
going	0
on	0
that's	0
causing	0
you	0
anxiety	2
 Once	0
you	0
figure	0
out	0
the	0
underlying	0
meaning	0
of	0
the	0
anxiety	1
you	0
can	0
figure	0
out	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
handle	0
it	0
and	0
action	0
steps	0
to	0
take	0
to	0
diminish	0
it	2
I'm	0
so	0
sorry	0
you	0
had	0
that	0
horrible	0
experience! It's	0
common	0
for	0
those	0
who've	0
experienced	0
childhood	0
trauma(s)	0
to	0
not	0
disclose	0
the	0
events	0
until	0
later	0
in	0
life	2
Sometimes	0
it	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
safe	0
enough	0
to	0
share	0
the	0
information	0
until	0
the	0
person	0
who	0
hurt	0
them	0

far	0
away	1

even	0
dead.  Trusting	0
and	0
vulnerability	0
are	0
difficult	1

when	0
we've	0
been	0
hurt	2
So	1
it's	0
not	0
uncommon	0
for	0

everyday	0
over	0

over	0
(even	0

your	0

has	0
a	0
major	0
barrier	0

I'd	0

it	0

you	0

these	0

Sometimes	0
people	0
with	0
sexual	0
barriers	0
are	0
very	0
active	0
for	0

now	1
you	0
can	0
both	0

that	0
there	0
is	0
a	0

and	0
it's	0
hers	0

she	0
can	0

that	0

with	0
a	0

perhaps	0
a	0

It's	0

Part	0
of	0
handling	0
stress	0
is	0
making	0
sure	0
that	0
your	0

of	0
the	0
stress	0
is	0
accurate	2
Sometimes	0
stress	0
can	0
seem	0

it	0

One	0
thing	0
that	0
I	0
encourage	0
my	0
clients	0
to	0
do	0
is	0
to	0
ask	0
themselves	1
"What	0
is	0
this	0

really	0
about?"	0
Simplifying	0
stress	0

I	0

that	0

there	0
may	0
be	0
some	0
other	0
underlying	0
medical	0
issue	0
there	2
I	0
would	0
definitely	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0

whoever	0
has	0
prescribed	0
the	0
medication	0
as	0
well	0
as	0
a	0
neurologist	0
if	0
you've	0

There	0
are	0
so	0
many	0
medications	0
available	0
for	0
anxiety	0

that	0
there	0
may	0

that	1

you	0

treatments	0
such	0
as	0
deep	0
breathing	0

meditation	3
Meditation	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
effective	1
but	0
it	0
takes	0
practice	0
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
sit	0
cross-legged	0
for	0
hours	0
chanting	0
"Ohm"	0
to	0
meditate	2
It's	0
about	0
focusing	0
on	0
your	0
breath	1
rather	0
than	0
all	0
the	0
thoughts	0
that	0
are	0
racing	0
through	0
your	0

And	0
when	0
they	0
do	0
take	0
your	0

off	0
your	0
breath	1
simply	0
refocus	0
(and	0
refocus	0
and	0
refocus)	2
Like	0
I	0
said	1
it	0
takes	0
practice	1
so	0
don't	0
give	0
up	2
You	0
can	0
find	0
many	0
sites	0

look	0
around	0
and	0
see	0
what	0
works	0
best	0
for	0
you	2
Like	0
medication	1
you	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
one	0
that	0
works	0
best	0
and	0
that	0
might	0
take	0
some	0
experimentation.I	0
hope	0
this	0

best	0
of	0
luck	0
to	0
you	2
The	0
first	0
step	1
which	0
you've	0
taken	1
is	0
actually	0
wanting	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
someone	2
It's	0
a	0
great	0
sign	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
seeking	0
to	0
reach	0
out	0
for	0
help	2
And	0
there	0
are	0
therapists	0
everywhere	0
(there	0
are	0
even	0
therapists	0
online	1
so	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
that	0
close	0
to	0
them	0

are	0
several	0

to	0

the	0
process	0
of	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
therapist	2
I	0
usually	0
have	0
them	0
start	0
with	0
psychologytoday.com	2
Once	0
there	0
(there	0
is	0
a	0
therapist	0
directory)	1
you	0
can	0
narrow	0
choices	0
down	0
by	0
ages	0
that	0
they	0
work	0
with	1
insurance	0
they	0
accept	1
depression	0

an	0
issue	0
they	0
focus	0
in	1
etc	2
You	0
can	0
also	0
narrow	0
down	0
by	0
therapist's	0
modality	1
but	0
that	0
can	0
get	0
complicated	0
if	0
you	0
aren't	0
too	0
familiar	0
with	0
the	0
various	0
theoretical	0
approaches	2
It's	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
someone	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
understands	0
your	0
situation	2
That	0
might	0

that	0
they	0

you	0
are	0
having	0
in	0
their	0

on	0

you	0

a	0

of	0
different	0
therapists	0
if	0
you	0
aren't	0
quite	0
sure	2
It	0
can	0
be	0
challenging	0
that	0
first	0
session	1
but	0
your	0
best	0
(note	1
not	0
"THE	0

therapist	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
(or	0
as	0
comfortable	0
as	0
possible	1
given	0
therapy	0
can	0
be	0
uncomfortable	0
especially	0
at	0
first)	0
and	0
understood	0
from	0
the	0
get-go.I	0
have	0
found	0
that	0
asking	0
friends	0
or	0
family	0
for	0
names	0
and	0
recommendations	0
Is	0
also	0
a	0
common	0
way	0
to	0
find	0
a	0
therapist	1
because	0
it	0
can	0
come	0
from	0
a	0
trusted	0
referral	0
source	2
But	0
remember	0
that	0
we	0
are	0
all	0
different	1
so	0
what	0
works	0
for	0
one	0
might	0
not	0
always	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
fit	2
And	0
again	1
it	0
could	0
take	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
first	0
sessions	0
with	0
different	0
therapists	0
to	0
know	0
if	0
someone	0
is	0
a	0
good	0

(sometimes	1
it	0

if	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
one	0
around	0
that	0
can	0
give	0
a	0

two	1
then	0
searching	0
online	0
is	0

Finding	0

one	0
for	0

to	0

a	0
judgment	0
about	0
the	0

what	0
she	0

giving	0

she	0

her	0

two	0

with	0
her	0
and	0
ask	0
her	0
if	0
she	0

opening	0
your	0

her.Or	1
simply	0
wait	0

see	0
what	0
she	0

when	0
you	0
contact	0
her	0
in	0
a	0

attention	0

you	0
get	0
more	0
answers	0
from	0
her	0

then	0
it	0
is	0
time	0
to	0
put	0
the	0

It	0

I	0
have	0
gone	0
myself	0

know	0
what	0
that	0

you	0
have	0

something	0
to	0
bring	0
up	0
to	0
your	0

and	0
openly	0
discuss	0
(scary	0
to	0

this	0
may	0

relieve	0

am	0
glad	0

a	0

That	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
most	0
men	0
struggle	0
with	0
doing	0
at	0
times. 	0
Time	0
will	0
tell	0

remember	0

of	0
worry	0

 Working	0
off	0

with	0
your	0

about	0

your	0

develop	0
the	0
relationship	0
you	0

 	0
It's	0
completely	0
understandable	0
that	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
male	0

that	0
you	0
would	0

 When	0
you	0

over	0
from	0

your	0

is	0
upset	0
by	0
you	0
spending	0
time	0
with	0
this	0
male	0
friend	1
then	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
it	2
 Each	0
of	0
you	0
needs	0
to	0

about	0
the	0
situation	0
and	0
listen	0
to	0
the	0
other	0
with	0
patience	0
and	0

 Then	0
you	0
can	0
make	0
a	0
decision	0
on	0
what	0
is	0
best	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0

 Maybe	0

if	0
you	0

this	0
friend	0
while	0
you	0
were	0
with	0
your	0

 Or	0

 Most	0

 But	0
if	0
you	0
really	0
care	0
about	0

then	0
you	0
probably	0
care	0
about	0

 Instead	0

not	0
always	0
see	0
it	0
that	0
way).As	0
far	0
as	0
whether	0
you	0
can	0
sign	0
him	0
in	1
that	0
depends	0
on	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
different	0
things.I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
Google	0
the	0
state	0
and	0
county	0
that	0
you	0
live	0
in	0
as	0
well	0
as	0
some	0
phrase	0
similar	0
to	0
"crisis	0
hotline."	0
They	0
can	0
tell	0
you	0
how	0
it	0
works	0
in	0
that	0
county	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
sign	0
him	0
in	0
as	0
long	0
as	0
he	0
met	0
the	0
criteria	0
for	0
admission	0
at	0
that	0
moment	1
but	0
I	0
can't	0
 be	0
entirely	0
sure. You	0
could	0
also	0
ask	0
the	0
person	0
on	0
the	0
phone	0
about	0
financial	0
responsibility	2
I	0
have	0
not	0
heard	0
of	0
that	0
being	0
a	0
problem	1
but	0
I	0
guess	0
it	0
would	0
depend	0
on	0
insurance.If	0
you	0
have	0
trouble	0
finding	0
a	0
local	0
 hotline	1
consider	0
calling	0
the	0
national	0
crisis	0
number	0

Starting	0
the	0
counseling	0
process	0
can	0
be	0
daunting	0
but	0
here	0
are	0
some	0
ways	0
that	0
hopefully	0
help	0
make	0
the	0
process	0
a	0
little	0
less	0
overwhelming. First,I'd	0
start	0
with	0
finding	0
a	0
therapist	0
through	0
a	0
therapist	0
directory	0
and	0
searching	0
for	0
a	0
therapist	0
specifically	0
in	0
your	0
area	0
and	0
with	0
the	0
expertise	0
you're	0
looking	0
for	2
There	0
are	0
many	0
reputable	0
therapist	0
directories	0
online	0
that	0
offer	0
specific	0
information	0
and	0
links	0
to	0
therapist	0
websites	0
to	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
how	0
they	0
can	0
help.Next, I'd	0
pick	0
two	0
or	0
three	0
of	0
interest	0
to	0
contact	0
directly	2
Have	0
a	0
list	0
of	0
questions	0
that	0
are	0
important	0
to	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
ask	0
to	0
determine	0
whether	0
a	0
particular	0
therapist	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
fit	2
Many	0
therapists	0
offer	0
a	0
free	0
phone	0
consultation	0
to	0
allow	0
you	0
both	0
to	0
determine	0
whether	0
it	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
fit.Then	1
after	0
you	0
schedule	1
the	0
next	0
step	0
is	0
to	0

what	0
it's	0

I'm	0
alway	0
wary	0
of	0
assigning	0
a	0
term	0
to	0
a	0
feeling	1
as	0
often	0
that	0

becomes	0
more	0

than	0
the	0

itself	2
From	0
the	0
very	0
little	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
written	1
it	0
is	0
clear	0
that	0
you	0
are	0

All	0

aspects	0
of	0

depressed	1
though	0
you	0
can	0
be	0
depressed	0
and	0
still	0
not	0
have	0
"depression". Counseling	0
is	0
definitely	0
a	0
place	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
go	0
and	0
sort	0
out	0
why	0
you	0

had	0
such	0
a	0
sudden	0
a	0
drastic	0
change	0
to	0
your	0

Sometimes	0
our	0
mood	0
can	0
be	0
effected	0
by	0
changes	0
in	0
our	0
routine	1
losses	0

Talking	0
with	0

help	0
you	0
to	0
better	0
understand	0
why	0
you	0

this	0

Feeling	0
alone	0
can	0
be	0
harmful	0
over	0
long	0
periods	0
of	0
time	1
as	0
it	0
can	0

I	0
am	0
sorry	0
to	0
hear	0
of	0
your	0

thing	0
I	0
wonder	0
is	0
did	0
you	0
volunteer	0
the	0
information	0
about	0
your	0
past	0
or	0
is	0
this	0
something	0
that	0
he	0

In	0

it	0
is	0
probably	0
best	0
to	0
leave	0
details	0
out	0
of	0

like	0
this	2
I	0
think	0
it	0
is	0
common	0
and	0
natural	0
for	0
partners	0
to	0
ask	0
about	0
the	0
sexual	0
history	2
For	0
one	0
thing	1
it	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
be	0
checked	0
for	0
STD’s	0
before	0
entering	0
into	0
a	0
sexual	0
relationship	0
with	0
someone	1
and	0
it	0
is	0
fair	0
to	0
share	0
that	0
information	0
with	0
each	0
other	2
Partners	0
usually	0
want	0
to	0

how	0

into	0
a	0
gray	0
area	0
for	0
some	0
people	2
I	0
don’t	0
necessarily	0

your	0
question	2
First	0
things	0
first	1
I	0
am	0
so	0
glad	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
alive	0

very	0
sorry	0
that	0
you	0

to	0

such	0
a	0
terrible	0
experience	2
Now	1
let's	0
talk	0
about	0
these	0
nightmares	2
The	0
first	0
thing	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
NOT	0
losing	0
your	0
mind	2
Many	0
people	0
start	0
to	0
think	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
the	0
case	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
still	0
suffering	0
from	0
the	0
affects	0
of	0
something	0
that	0
happened	0
a	0
long	0

That's	0
not	0
the	0
case	2
There	0
is	0
no	0
time	0
set	0
time	0
for	0
which	0
we	0
should	0
be	0
"over"	0
something	0
like	0
this	2
I	0
am	0
not	0
sure	0
if	0
you	0
received	0
counseling	0
after	0
what	0
happened	0
to	0
you	1
but	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
to	0
consider	2
Bad	0
nightmares	0
could	0
be	0
the	0
sign	0
of	0
something	0
like	0
Post	0
Traumatic	0
Stress	0
Disorder	0
(PTSD)	1
which	0
would	0
include	0
other	0
symptoms	0
like	0
being	0
startled	0
easily	1
re-experiencing	0
the	0
event	1
or	0
avoiding	0
places	0
that	0
remind	0
you	0
of	0
it	2
There	0
are	0
other	0
symptoms	1
as	0
well	1
so	0
if	0
you	0
believe	0
this	0
may	0
be	0
something	0
you	0
have	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
seek	0
counseling	2
There	0
are	0
good	0
treatments	0
for	0
PTSD	2
If	0
you	0
cannot	0
seek	0
counseling at	0
this	0

things	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
manage	0
the	0
dreams	0
on	0
your	0
own	2
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
look	0
up	0
"sleepy	0
hygiene"	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
make	0
your	0
bedtime	0
rituals	0
as	0
relaxing	0
as	0
possible	2
You	0
can	0
also	0
Google	0
search	0
"Nightmare	0
re-scripting"	0
or	0
"Nightmare	0
Exposure"	0
and	0
get	0
some	0
ideas	0
on	0
how	0
you	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
change	0
your	0
dreams	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
attend	0
a	0

group	0

get	0

the	0

is	0
just	0
an	0

as	0

not	0

realize	0
that	0
this	0

reality	0
is	0
dualistic	0
in	0
nature;	0
that	0
means	0
there	0
is	0
two	0
of	0

imagine	0
that	0
whatever	0

you	0

whatever	0
words	0
come	0

also	0
think	0

you'll	0
have	0
a	0
good	0

Hi	0
Morristown,There's	0
a	0
saying	0
that	0
goes	0
"hurt	0
people	0
hurt	0
people"	2
It's	0
possible	0
that	0
your	0
aggression	0
towards	0
your	0
friends	0
is	0
connected	0
to	0
your	0
mother's	0
behaviours	2
When	0
we	0
are	0
treated	0
poorly	1
especially	0
as	0
children	1
it	0
affects	0
how	0
we	0
ourselves	1
others	1
and	0
the	0
world	2
It's	0
also	0
powerful	0
modelling	0
of	0
aggressive	0
behaviour. The	0
good	0
news	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
this	0
lovely	0
awareness	0
and	0
I	0
think	0
a	0

your	0
ability	0
to	0
be	0

I	0

exploring	0

moving	0

that	0
you	0

I	0
don't	0

convey	0
that	0
everyone	0

rather	0
that	0

This	0
does	0
not	0

to	0

resources.As	0
far	0
as	0
telling	0
your	0
dad	1
if	0
that	0
is	0
particularly	0
concerning	0
for	0
you	1
I	0
suggest	0
either	0
talking	0
through	0
the	0
details	0
with	0
a	0

if	0
you	0

Hi!This	0
is	0
a	0
great	0
question!The	0

alexithymia	1
the	0
inability	0
to	0
identify	0
and	0

However	1
just	0
because	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
able	0
to	0
feel	0

emotions	1
does	0
not	0
mean	0
that	0
you	0

emotions.After	0
such	0
a	0
traumatic	0
event	0
that	0
you	0

(dorsal	0
vagal	0
nerves)	0
that	0
protect	0
you	0
from	0
any	0
further	0
harm	2
What	0
this	0

is	0
if	0
you	0
were	0
to	0
feel	0
your	0
emotions	0
related	0
to	0
your	0
rape	1
you	0

overwhelmed	1
possibly	0
re-experiencing	0
the	0

you	0

Unfortunately	1
when	0

(pain	1

You	0

I'm	0

the	0

right	0
his	0

emotionally	0
safe	0
place.I'm	0
a	0
bit	0
confused	1
because	0
the	0
obvious	0
answer	0
seems	0
to	0
be	0
that	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
fiancé	0
would	0
get	0
your	0
own	0
place	0
together. I	0
get	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
your	0
dad	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
all	0

you	1
but	0
maybe	0
it's	0
time	0
to	0
take	0
responsibility	0
for	0
your	0
own	0
future	0
and	0
start	0
building	0
it	0
independently	0
of	0
either	0
parent	2
I	0
say	0
that	0
without	0
knowing	0
how	0
old	0
you	0
are	1
but	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
child	0
and	0
a	0
two	0
year	0
relationship	1
you	0
basically	0
have	0
declared	0
your	0
independence	0
anyway.  I	0
wish	0
you	0
the	0
best	2
Could	0
you	0
tell	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
First	1
I	0
want	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
how	0
sorry	0
I	0
am	0
for	0
the	0
experience	0
you	0
had	0
with	0
your	0
parents	2
That	0
is	0
a	0
grief	0
and	0
trauma	0
that	0
is	0
certainly	0
hard	0
to	0
imagine	2
Trauma	0
and	0
grief	0
can	0
affect	0
us	0
in	0
many	0
ways	1
and	0
certainly	0
deeply	0
personal	0
things	0
like	0
our	0
sex	0
lives	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
difficult	0
for	0
others	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
connection	1
but	0
it	0
is	0
there	2
So	1
for	0
example	1
if	0
stress	0
and	0
trauma	0
make	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
interested	0
in	0
sex	1
a	0
partner	0
may	0
take	0
it	0
as	0
a personal	0
rejection	0
rather	0
than response	0
to	0
stress	1
trauma	0
or	0
grief	2
If	0
your	0
husband	0
will	0
agree	0
to	0
it	1
couple's	0
counseling	0
may	0
be	0
your	0
best	0
bet	2
A	0
counselor	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
with	0
your	0
communication	0
and	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
provide	0
some	0
education	0
to	0
your	0
husband	0
about	0
trauma	0
and	0
how	0
it	0
can	0
have	0
an	0
impact	0
on	0
intimacy	2
If	0
he	0
doesn't	0
agree	0
to	0
go	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
worth	0
it	0
to	0
go	0
on	0
your	0
own	2
You	0
still	0
have	0
a	0
lot	0
you	0
are	0
dealing	0
with	0
yourself	2
And	0
sometimes	0
our	0
personally	0
therapy	0
can	0
influence others	1
so	0
it may	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	2
It	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
that	0
even	0
though	0
you	0
are	0
married	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
right	0
to	0
make	0
decisions	0
about	0
your	0
body	1
and	0
that	0
includes	0
when	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
sex	0
with	0
it	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
is	0
helpful	1

some	0

ideas	1

food	2
Food	0

us	0
with	0

yes	1
sometimes	0

if	0

until	0
that	0
"special"	0
donut. Another	0
aspect	0
we	0
need	0
to	0

about	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
Being	0
bisexual	0
can	0
be	0
particularly	0
difficult	0
because	0
it	0
is	0
often	0
misunderstood	1
even	0
by	0
people	0
who	0
are	0
“supposed”	0
to	0
be	0
part	0
of	0
your	0
own	0
community	1
such	0
as	0
lesbians	0
and	0
gays	2
It	0
happens	0
so	0
often	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
actually	0
a	0
term	0
for	0
it	0
– 	0
bi-erasure	2
This	0
is	0
simply	0
something	0
that	0
happens	0
when	0
people	0
deny	0
that	0
bisexuality	0
is	0
a	0
real	0
thing	1
or	0
discriminate	0
against	0
bisexuals	0
due	0
to	0
beliefs	0
like	0
your	0
parents	0
seem	0
to	0
have	2
The	0
unfortunate	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
never	0
be	0
sure	0
of	0
how	0
you	0
parents	0
may	0
take	0
this	0
kind	0
of	0
information	2
It	0
sounds	0
promising	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
accepting	0
of	0
other	0
sexual	0
orientations	1
and	0
it	0
may	0
simply	0
be	0
that	0
your	0
parents	0
lack	0
education	0
about	0
bisexuality	2
With	0
accurate	0
information	1
they	0
may	0
come	0
around	1
but	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
be	0
sure	2
Some	0
of	0
my	0
colleagues	0
have	0
already	0
given	0
you	0
good	0
information	2
Here	0
are	0
some	0
more things	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
consider	0
and	0
questions	0
you	0
can	0
ask	0
yourself	0
before	0
making	0
the	0
decision	0
to	0
tell	0
them:	0
 	0
1.     	0
If	0
they	0
don’t	0
respond	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
want	0
them	0
to	1
have	0
you	0
developed	0
a	0
support	0
system	0
to	0
support	0
you	0
through	0
it	3
This	0
is	0
very	0
important	2
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
all	0
the	0
friends	0
in	0
the	0
world	0
won’t	0
prevent	0
pain	0
or	0
sadness	0
if	0
your	0
parents	0
don’t	0
respond	0
as	0
you	0
hope	1
but	0
they	0
will	0
at	0

be	0
there	0
to	0
remind	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
ARE	0
okay	0
as	0
you	0

And	0
that	0
is	0
critical	0

2.     	0
There	0

information	0

about	0
bisexuality	0

if	0
you	0

it	0
would	0
be	0
helpful	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
important	0
for	0
them	0

know	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
damage	0
that	0
is	0

Coming	0
out	0
to	0
people	0
is	0
obviously	0
deeply	0
personal	0
and	0
should	0
only	0
take	0
place	0
when	0
you	0

Sometimes	0

don’t	0

you	0

come	0
out	0

Something	0
else	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
is	0
your	0
own	0
comfort	0
in	0
being	0
bisexual	2
Just	0
because	0
someone	0
is	0
LGBTQ	0
doesn’t	0

that	0
they	0

to	0

Many	0
people	0
struggle	0
with	0
this	2
Having	0
your	0

also	0
play	0
a	0
part	0
in	0
how	0
comfortable	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
telling	0
your	0
parents	2
So	1
perhaps	0
do	0
some	0
self-exploration	0
about	0
your	0
feelings	0
toward	0
yourself	2
 	0
Sometimes	0
people	0
take	0
friends	0
with	0
them	0
when	0
they	0
decide	0
to	0
come	0
out	0
to	0
their	0
parents	2
This	0
is	0
something	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
consider	2
The	0
important	0
thing	0
to	0
remember	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
okay	2
Really	2
If	0
your	0
parents	0
don’t	0
respond	0
well	1
that	0
doesn’t	0

that	0
they	0
never	0

Some	0

Here's	0
why	0
I	0
say	0
that: One	0
quite	0
important	0
healing	0
factor	0
in	0
a	0
psychotherapy	0
is	0
discovering	0
that	0
problems	0
in	0
the	0
therapy	0
and	0
the	0
therapeutic	0
relationship	0
can	0
be	0
solved	0
together. It	0
is	0
a	0
safety	0
zone	0
or	0
bridge	0
for	0
practicing	0
that	2
If	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
done	0
with	0
a	0
trained	1
usually	0
safe	0
person	0
(the	0
therapist)	1
the	0
client	0
might	0
think	1
wow--what	0
are	0
the	0
implications	0
for	0
my	0
outside	0
life	0
and	0
relations	3
Could	0
I	0
get	0
what	0
I	0
want	0
outside	0
of	0
therapy	1
too	1
even	0
if	0
it	0
feels	0
not	0
as	0
safe?If	0
the	0
therapist	0
can	0
deal	0
with	0
feedback	0
(and	0
any	0
good	0
therapist	0
should	0
be	0
able	0
to)	1
this	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
productive	2
Cooperation	0
in	0
this	0
way	1

the	0

with	0
a	0

person	0
who	0
is	0
supposed	0
to	0
have	0
authority	0
and	0
knowledge	0
in	0
these	0
matters	1
can	0
be	0
profoundly	0
healing.If	0
the	0
therapist	0
can't	0
take	0
feedback	0
or	0
doesn't	0
want	0
to--or	0
does	0
nothing	0

I	0

what's	0
been	0
happening	0
that	0

caused	0
a	0
drift	0
in	0
your	0

also	0
curious	0
if	0
there	0

this	0

It	0
can	0
provide	0
a	0

This	0

your	0

Try	0

something	0
to	0

One	0
of	0
the	0
first	0
things	0
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
is	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
keep	0
track	0
of	0
what	0
is	0
leading	0
you	0
to	0
feel	0
anxious. If	0
you	0
shake	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
consider	0
talking	0
with	0
your	0
primary	0
care	0
physician	2
Sometimes	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
hormonal	0
imbalance	0
or	0
another	0
chemical	0
imbalance	0
(such	0
as	0
thyroid).One	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
difficult	0
things	0
about	0
anxiety	0
is	0
that	0
having	0
anxiety	0
(particularly	0
panic	0
attacks)	0
can	0
lead	0
to	0
anxiety	0
about	0
having	0
more	0
panic	0
attacks	2
Also	0
remember	0
that	0
panic	0
attacks	0
are	0
typically	0
part	0
of	0
your	0
brain's	0
protective	0
response	0
to	0
what	0
it	0
considers	0
to	0
be	0
some	0
sort	0
of	0
threat	2
You	0
may	0
have	0
heard	0
of	0
the	0
fight	0
or	0
flight	0
response	2
When	0
you	0
have	0
an	0
anxiety	0
attack	1
your	0
body	0
is	0
preparing	0
you	0
to	0
react	0
to	0
something	0
that	0
isn't	0
actually	0
a	0
threat	1
so	0
it's	0
almost	0
as	0
if	0

is	1
YES!	0
Counseling	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
helpful	0
to	0
people	0
struggling	0
with	0
many	0
different	0
things	2
There	0
has	0
been	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
research	0
conducted	0
to	0
prove	0
that	0
counseling	0
is	0
an	0
effective	0
way	0
to	0
help	0
people	0
with	0
mental	0
health	0
concerns	1
life	0
stressors	1
and	0
many	0
other	0
issues	2
In	0
addition	1
there	0
are	0
many	0
people	0
who	0
would	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0
counseling	0
made	0
a	0
positive	1
profound	0
impact	0
on	0
their	0
lives	2
Indeed	1
some	0
would	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0
counseling	0
saved	0
their	0
lives	2
Now	1
not	0
everyone	0
would	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0
counseling	0
helped	2
But	0
when	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
it	1
there	0
are	0
many	0
medical	0
treatments	0
for	0
a	0
variety	0
of	0
healthcare	0
issues	0
that	0
also	0
do	0
not	0
help	0
everyone	2
So	1
is	0
counseling	0
guaranteed	3
No	2
But	1
it	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
is	0
worth	0
trying	0
if	0
someone	0
is	0
suffering	0
or	0
is	0
just	0
wanting	0
some	0
perspective	0
or	0
support	2
Also	1
there	0
is	0
many	0
different	0
types	0
of	0
counseling	2
Different	0
counselors	0
have	0
different	0
styles	0
and	0
have	0
different	0
training	0
for	0
various	0
issues	2
This	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
are	0

to	0
find	0
someone	0

has	0
a	0
good	0
style	0
and	0
expertise	0

an	0
area	0
that	0
you	0

to	0
work	0
on	2
If	0
you	0
don't	0
know	0
where	0
to	0
go	1
I	0
suggest	0
contacting	0
your	0
state's	0
counseling	0
association	2
They	0
can	0
help	2
I	0
think	0
the	0
real	0
question	0
that	0
most	0
people	0
have	0
is	1
how	3
How	0
does	0
it	0
help	3
That	0
question	0
is	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
complicated	1
because	0
there	0
are	0
many	0
different	0
models	0
of	0
counseling/therapy	0
that	0
work	0
in	0
different	0
ways	2
What	0
I	0
can	0
tell	0
you	0
is	0
that	1
regardless	0
of	0
the	0
model	0
of	0
counseling	1
the	0
relationship	0
between	0
counselor	0
and	0
client	0
is	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
factor	2
I	0
don't	0
mean	0
that	0
the	0
relationship	0
has	0
to	0
be	0
ooowy	0
goowy..	2

it	0
does	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
one	0
where	0
there	0
is	0
trust	0
and	0

A	0

Hi	0
Los	0
Angeles	1
I	0
can	0
tell	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
moral	0
backbone	0
because	0
it's	0
hurting	0
you	0
to	0
lie	0
to	0
your	0
mom	2
I	0
always	0
say	0
that	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
guilt	0
is	0
healthy	0
because	0
it	0
teaches	0
us	0
who	0
we	0
want	0
to	0
be	2
Listen	0
to	0
that	0
voice	2
You	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
lie	0
to	0
your	0
mom	0
to	0
get	0
what	0
you	0
want.Now	1
you	0
don't	0
say	0
how	0
old	0
you	0
are	1
so	0
part	0
of	0
my	0
answer	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
bit	0
vague	2
There's	0
a	0
big	0
difference	0
between	0
being	0
thirteen	0
and	0
your	0
mom	0
telling	0
you	0
what	0
to	0
do	0
and	0
being	0
nineteen	0
and	0
your	0
mom	0
telling	0
you	0
what	0
to	0
do	2
The	0
thing	0
is	0
that	0
moms	0
and	0
dads	0
start	0
out	0
making	0
all	0
your	0
decisions	0
for	0
you	0
when	0
you're	0
small	1
and	0
they're	0
supposed	0
to	1
very	0
gradually	1
give	0
that	0
control	0
over	0
to	0
you	2
Different	0
parents	0
do	0
this	0
at	0
different	0
speeds	1
but	0
in	0
general	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
earn	0
that	0
freedom	0
and	0
trust...it's	0
not	0
just	0
gonna	0
be	0
handed	0
over	0
to	0
you. You	0
might	0
not	0
like	0
this	0
part...your	0
parent	0
has	0
the	0
right	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
rules	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
there's	0
a	0
reason	0
why	0
mom	0
is	0
holding	0
you	0
back	2
Even	0
if	0
it	0
doesn't	0
make	0
sense	0
to	0
you	1
breaking	0
her	0
rules	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
get	0
you	0
what	0
you	0
want...which	0
is	0
freedom	1
right	3
I	0
guarantee	0
you	0
that	0
mom	0
wants	0
you	0
to	0
eventually	0
earn	0
freedom...but	0
she's	0
not	0
supposed	0
to	0
give	0
it	0
to	0
you	0
until	0
you're	0
ready	0
because	0
her	0
first	0
job	0
is	0
to	0
keep	0
you	0
safe. I	0
like	0
that	0
your	0
mom	0
has	0
limits	0
for	0
you	2
Too	0
many	0
parents	0
are	0
sort	0
of	0
looking	0
the	0
other	0
way	1
busy	0
with	0
their	0
own	0
thing	2
Whether	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
or	0
not	1
you	0
need	0
protection	0
like	0
all	0
kids	0
do	0
(appropriate	0
for	0
your	0
age	1
of	0
course).It	0
sounds	0
like	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
your	0
mom	0
is	0
"I	0
want	0
to	0
make	0
my	0
own	0
decisions	0
about	0
who	0
I	0
spend	0
time	0
with"	2
That's	0
a	0
normal	0
wish	1
and	0
I	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
say	0
that	0
to	0
her	2
Depending	0
on	0
your	0
age	0
and	0
whether	0
you've	0
earned	0
it	1
she	0
might	0
listen. So	1
you're	0
sending	0
her	0
that	0
message	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
send	1
but	0
you're	0
doing	0
it	0
in	0
a	0
sneaky	0
way	1
and	0
that's	0
not	0
going	0
to	0
go	0
well	0
when	0
she	0
finds	0
out	2
It's	0
called	0
"passive	0
aggressive"	0
when	0
you	0
say	0
something	0
with	0
a	0
sneaky	0
behaviour	0
rather	0
than	0
with	0
words	2
It's	0
not	0
a	0
very	0
healthy	0
way	0
of	0
sending	0
a	0
message	1
because	0
people	0
feel	0
disrespected. My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
your	0
best	0
bet	0
is	0
to	0
be	0
honest	0
with	0
mom	1
stop	0
the	0
sneaking	0
around	0
and	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
a	0
detailed	0
plan	0
of	0
how	0
you're	0

your	0

She	0

that	2

wonder	0
what	0
has	0
changed	0
since	0

hospital	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
this	0
and	0
mention	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
asking	0
him	0
questions	0
to	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0

you	0
notice	0
that	0

better	0
when	0
he	0
came	0
home	0
from	0
the	0

and	0
now	0
things	0
are	0
not	0
as	0
good	2
Perhaps	0
he	0
can	0
tell	0
you	0
about	0
what	0
is	0
different	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
know	0
him	0
would	0
be	0
most	0
helpful	0
to	0
him.I	0
also	0
hope	0
that	0
you	0
husband	0
is	0
still	0
continuing	0
with	0
his	0
own	0
treatment.There	0
may	0

for	0

that	0

again	2
There	0
are	0
national	0

well	2
Probably	0
the	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
be	0
supportive	0
of	0

to	0
tell	0

way	0
he's	0

your	0

then	0
before	0

be	0
sure	0
to	0
validate	0
his	0
strong	0
points	0

to	0

are	0

Bipolar	0

make	0
behavior	0

that	0

For	0

some	0

may	0
not	0

to	0

and	0
speak	0
with	0
a	0

over	0

for	0
you.Regardless	0

Hi	2
I	0
appreciate	0
your	0
mature	0
instincts	0
and	0
strong	0
efforts	0
to	0
draw	0
clear	0
boundaries	0
in	0
this	0
very	0
complex	0
situation	2
I	0
agree	0
that	0
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
the	0
adult	0
drama	0
is	0
unnecessary	0
and	0
potentially	0
will	0
affect	0
the	0
children. Children	0
need	0
adults	0
around	0
them	0
to	0
act	0
maturely	1
cooperatively	0
and	0
peacefully	0
even	0
when	0
they	0
don't	0
like	0
each	0
other;	0
it	0
helps	0
them	0
feel	0
secure	0
and	0
lets	0
them	0
focus	0
on	0
learning	0
and	0
growing	2
Your	0
ex-boyfriend seems	0
more	0
focused	0
on	0
his	0
own	0
needs	2
In	0
fact	1
he	0
demonstrates	0
behaviours	0
that	0
are	0
aggressive	1
controlling	0
and	0
manipulative	1
bordering	0
on	0
'parental	0
alienation'	2
I	0
agree	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
problem.I	0
also	0
appreciate	0
how	0
protective	0
you	0
are	0
of	0
yourself	0
at	0
this	0
vulnerable	0
time	0
with	0
the	0
pregnancy	2
It's	0
not	0
unusual	0
for	0
pregnancy	0
to	0
trigger	0
a	0
need	0
to	0
conserve	0
energy	0
and	0
reduce	0
stress	2
Honour	0
this	0
instinct	0
you	0
have. I	0
will	0
suggest	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
to	0
you	2
First	1
to	0
gather	0
support	0
around	0
you	1
professionally	0
if	0
you	0
need	0
it	1
from	0
family	0
and	0
friends	1
and	0
certainly	0
from	0
your	0
husband	2
If	0
you	0
two	0
are	0
on	0
the	0
same	0
page	0
regarding	0
the	0
children	0
issues	0
and	0
your	0
ex	1
that	0
will	0
help	2
He	0
can	0
help	0
run	0
interference	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
his	0
daughter	2
It	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
feel	0
supported.Know	0
that	0
your	0
ex's	0
behaviours	0
aren't	0
happening	0
because	0
you	0
did	0
anything	0
wrong;	0
it's	0
the	0
way	0
he	0
operates	0
(and	0
maybe	0
this	0
is	0
why	0
you're	0
not	0
with	0
him?)	2
You	0
can't	0
change	0
him	1
but	0
you	0
can	0
stop	0
blaming	0
yourself	0
for	0
his	0
immaturity	0
and	0
aggression	2
You're	0
correct	0
that	0
he	0
will	0
always	0
be	0
there	1
and	0
you	0
can	0
both	0
accept	0
this	0
fact	0
and	0
also	0
find	0
ways	0
to	0
manage	0
the	0
situation.Keep	0
on	0
defining	0
clear	0
boundaries!	0
You	0
might	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
broken	0
record	0
("You'll	0
have	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
my	0
husband	0
about	0
that")	1
but	0
that's	0
okay	2
It's	0
okay	0
to	0
ignore	0
his	0
efforts	0
to	0
pull	0
you	0
into	0
an	0
argument	0
or	0
power	0
struggle	2
It's	0
okay	0
to	0
not	0
respond	0
to	0
texts	0
or	0
other	0
communications	0
that	0
aren't	0
vitally	0
important	2
It's	0
okay	0
to	0
not	0
let	0
him	0
into	0
your	0
house	0
if	0
it	0
makes	0
you	0
uncomfortable	2
It's	0
okay	0
to	0
not	0
engage	0
with	0
him	0
more	0
than	0
is	0
necessary.Regarding	0
his	0
manipulative	0
behaviours	0
that	0
reflect	0
a	0
tendency	0
to	0
keep	0
your	0
daughter	0
from	0
you	1
I	0
recommend	0
you	0
document	0
these	0
behaviours	0
and	0
incidents	0
carefully	0
and	0
fully	2
Let	0
him	0
know	0
what	0
your	0
expectations	0
are	1
simply	0
and	0
clearly	0
and	0
in	0
writing	0
("our	0

Your	0
daughter	0
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
aware;	0
I	0
think	0
you	0
already	0
understand	0
that	0
she	0
needs	0
to	0

the	0
adult	0
conflict.A	0
professional	0
therapist	0
can	0

you	0

Hi	0
Michigan	1
Relationships	0
are	0
so	0
sparkly	0
for	0
a	0
few	0
years	1
and	0
then	0
things	0
start	0
to	0
feel	0
different	2
Most	0
of	0
the	0
time	1
this	0
is	0
simply	0
because	0
we've	0
pulled	0
back	0
from	0
all	0
the	0
attachment-forming	0
behaviours	0
we	0
did	0
at	0
the	0
beginning	2
We	0
stop	0
talking	0
a	0
lot	1
because	0
we	0
have	0
less	0
to	0
discover...we	0
do	0
less	0
for	0
each	0
other	0
and	0
buy	0
fewer	0
gifts...spend	0
less	0
time	0
together...all	0
because	0
we	0
have	0
already	0
formed	0
the	0
love	0
and	0
attachment	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
need	0
to	0
"fill	0
the	0
gas	0
tank"	0
as	0
much	2
So	1
just	0
because	0
it	0
feels	0
different	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
it's	0
"gone	0
bad".Having	0
said	0
that	1
it	0
seems	0
as	0
though	0
you	0
are	0
missing	0
something	0
in	0
this	0
relationship	0
that	0
you	0
need;	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0

enough	0
right	0
now	2
Can	0
you	0
tell	0
him	3
Have	0
you	0

The	0

Let	0
him	0

it. You	0

there	0

You	0

want	0
to	0
explore	0
other	0

walk	0
away	2

often	0
it's	0

it	0

Good	0
for	0

I	0

some	0

First	1
good	0
for	0
you	0
for	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0

making	0
really	0
good	0
decisions	0
–	0
such	0
as	0
not	0
getting	0
into	0
the	0
car	0
with	0
dad	0
when	0
he	0
is	0
intoxicated	2
It	0
is	0
really	0
important	0
that	0

consider	0
your	0
safety	0
above	0
all	0

To	0
answer	0

question	1
yes	1
it	0
is	0
quite	0
common	0
for	0
people	0
to	0
blame	0
themselves	0
for	0
other	0
people’s	0
actions	2
There	0
are	0
various	0
reasons	0
why	0
we	0
do	0
this	2
For	0
one	0
thing	1
someone	0
may	0
tell	0
us	0
that	0
their	0
behaviors	0
are	0
our	0
fault	2
And	0
depending	0

things	0

our	0

that	0

may	0
actually	0

it	2
What	0
is	0
important	0
to	0

alcohol	0
abuse	0
problem	1

living	0
with	0

to	0

therapy.Discussing	0
your	0

the	0

step	0
to	0

believer	0
your	0
own	0
conclusion	0
about	0
your	0
well-being.Taking	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
drugs	0
creates	0
self-doubt	0
and	0
weakens	0
the	0
sense	0
of	0
self	0
that	0
people	0
naturally	0
have.My	0
wish	0
for	0
your	0
future	0
is	0
to	0
regain	0
trust	0
and	0
confidence	0
in	0
yourself	0
as	0
a	0

not	0
a	0
diagnosis	0

told	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0

Crying	0
is	0
a	0
natural	0
process	0
when	0
you	0
talk	0
about	0
upsetting	0
things	0
especially	0
in	0
therapy	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
opening	0
up	0
and	0
being	0
so	0
vulnerable	2
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
consider	0
how	0
you	0
would	0
feel/respond	0
to	0
someone	0
that	0
was	0
confiding	0
to	0
you	0
and	0
they	0
began	0
to	0
cry	2
If	0
you	0
felt	0
concerned	1
supportive	0
and	0
empathetic	0
then	0
you	0
know	0
exactly	0
how	0
us	0
therapists	0
feel	0
when	0
our	0
clients	0
are	0
emotional	0
in	0
sessions	2
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
think	0
of	0
times	0
where	0
you	0
have	0
cried	0
and	0
how	0
you	0
felt	0
at	0
that	0
time	0
in	0
public	0
and	0
what	0
would	0
have	0
helped	0
to	0
make	0
you	0
feel	0
less	0
uncomfortable	0
during	0
your	0
tears. I	0
think	0
of	0
crying	0
like	0
any	0
other	0
natural	0
reaction	0
of	0
our	0
body	0
such	0
as	0
sneezing	1
laughing	1
coughing	2
You	0
can't	0
help	0
but	0
do	0
those	0
things	0
and	0
most	0
people	0
won't	0
really	0
judge	0
negatively	0
if	0
you	0
do	0
it	0
in	0
public	2
Similarly	1
crying	0
is	0
our	0
body's	0
reaction	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
emotional	0
whether	0
it	0
is	0
tears	0
of	0
joy	1
from	0
a	0
hilarious	0
joke	0
or	0
from	0
being	0
upset. If	0
you	0
are	0
very	0
uncomfortable	0
about	0
crying	0
but	0
willing	0
to	0
start	0
therapy	0
perhaps	0
you	0
can	0
ask	0
the	0
therapist	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
turn	0
your	0
chair	0
around	0
if	0
you	0
begin	0
crying	2
This	0
way	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
facing	0
them	0
and	0
can	0
self	0
soothe	0
without	0
worrying	0
about	0
how	0
you	0

look	0
at	0

To	0
be	0

The	0

there	0

we	0

change	0
another	0

Many	0

by	0
telling	0
you	0
how	0
to	0
improve	0

What	0
is	0
actually	0
going	0
on	0

an	0
attempt	0
to	0
control	0
or	0
change	0
something	0
about	0
you	0
by	0

coercive	0

It	0

that	0
this	0

of	0
behavior	0
doesn't	0
necessarily	0
show	0
up	0
right	0
away	2
That	0

Here	0

some	0
ideas:1	2
You	0

about	0

the	0

I	0

the	0

One	1

the	0

not	0

that	0
way. 	0
Until	0
you	0
realize	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
problem	0
you	0
won’t	0
start	0
looking	0
for	0
a	0
solution.Don’t	0
misunderstand	0
me! 	0
The	0
abuse	0
is	0
not	0
your	0
fault!	0
You	0
are	0
seeing	0
a	0
pattern	1
though	1
so	0
this	0
does	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
addressed. First	1
go	0
and	0
buy	0
the	0
book	0
“Boundaries:	0
Where	0
You	0
End	0
and	0
I	0
Begin”	0
by	0
Anne	0
Katherine. 	0
Read	0
it. 	0
This	0
book	0
describes	0
many	0
situations	0
that	0
are	0
similar	0
to	0
yours	1
describes	0
how	0
a	0
person	0
came	0
to	0
be	0
that	0
way	1
and	0
how	0
to	0
stop	0
it. 	0
You	0
will	0
have	0
to	0
learn	0
to	0
set	0
good	0
boundaries	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
and	0
to	0
maintain	0
them.Be	0
single	0
for	0
a	0
while. 	0
Stay	0
single	0
until	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
a	0
whole	1
healthy	1
happy	0
person	0
on	0
your	0
own. 	0
Often	0
we	0
get	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
because	0
of	0
a	0
need. 	0
If	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
need	0
a	0
person	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
to	0
make	0
you	0
a	0
whole	0
person	0
then	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
for	0
the	0
wrong	0
reasons. 	0
The	0
first	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
whatever	0
it	0
is	0
in	0
you	0
that	0
makes	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
need	0
another	0
person	0
in	0
your	0
life. 	0
Identify	0
those	0
needs	0
and	0
then	0
learn	0
to	0
fulfill	0
them	0
on	0
your	0
own.I	0
was	0
doing	0
a	0
couples	0
therapy	0
session	0
and	0
the	0
husband	0
was	0
being	0
emotionally	0
abusive	0
to	0
the	0
wife. 	0
This	0
was	0
a	0
recurrent	0
theme	0
for	0
her	1
like	0
you	0
are	0
saying	0
it	0
is	0
for	0
you. 	0
However	1
she	0
had	0
been	0
doing	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	0
on	0
her	0
own	0
and	0
in	0
private	0
therapy	1
and	0
this	0
was	0
a	0
new	0
relationship. 	0
Obviously	0
she	0
still	0
had	0
not	0
“gotten	0
it	0
right”	0
because	0
she	0
did	0
once	0
again	0
attract	0
a	0
man	0
with	0
these	0
tendencies. 	0
The	0
difference	0
this	0
time	0
was	0
that	0
she	0
had	0
done	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
work	0
on	0
herself	0
and	0
had	0
become	0
a	0
stronger	0
person. 	0
When	0
she	0
looked	0
at	0
him	0
in	0
our	0
session	0
and	0
said	0
to	0
him	0
“I	0
don’t	0
need	0
you	2
I	0
want	0
you. 	0
But	0
not	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
continue	0
to	0
act	0
like	0
this. 	0
So	0
you	0
leave	0
the	0
house	0
and	0
don’t	0
come	0
back	0
until	0
you	0
are	0
ready	0
to	0
make	0
some	0
changes.” 	0
She	0
stuck	0
to	0
that	1
too. 	0
He	0
didn’t	0
leave	0
for	0
two	0
more	0
days	0
because	0
he	0
kept	0
telling	0
her	0
he	0
would	0
do	0
different	0
and	0
begging	0
to	0
be	0
allowed	0
to	0
stay. 	0
She	0
had	0
drawn	0
a	0
boundary	0
and	0
stuck	0
to	0
it	1
and	0
he	0
left	2
She	0
was	0
fully	0
prepared	0
to	0
be	0
single	0
again. 	0
They	0
actually	0
did	0
end	0
up	0
working	0
things	0
out	0
in	0
the	0
end.You	0
can’t	0
let	0
someone	0
stay	0
and	0
continue	0
to	0
treat	0
you	0
badly. 	0
Sure	1
a	0
marriage	0
takes	0
work	0
and	0
compromise	0
on	0
both	0
sides. 	0
Couples	0
therapy	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
both	0
learn	0
to	0
communicate	0
in	0
a	0
healthier	0
way	0
with	0
each	0
other	0
and	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
realize	0
what	0
areas	0
in	0
the	0
relationship	0
need	0
work. 	0
You	0
may	0
not	0
realize	0
how	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
things	0
you	0
say	0
to	0
him	0
comes	0
across	1
and	0
he	0
may	0
not	0
realize	0
how	0
what	0
he	0
says	0
does	0
to	0
you. 	0
A	0
therapist	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
with	0
this	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
both	0
learn	0
how	0
your	0
words	0
can	0
hurt	2
But	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
know	0
your	0
boundaries	0
and	0
be	0
prepared	0
to	0
stick	0
to	0
them	0
and	0
not	0
compromise	0
your	0
boundaries. 	0
That	0
means	0
following	0
through	0
on	0
the	0
threat	0
to	0
leave	0
when	0
he	0
continues	0
to	0
abuse	0
you. 	0
Someone	0
can’t	0
do	0
that	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
too	0
scared	0
to	0
be	0
alone. 	0
If	0
they	0
feel	0
they	0
need	0
the	0
other	0
person	0
in	0
their	0
life. These	0
patterns	0
are	0
developed	0
in	0
early	0
childhood	0
from	0
what	0
we	0
learn	0
from	0
our	0
parents. 	0
When	0
someone	0
has	0
grown	0
up	0
in	0
a	0
dysfunctional	0
family	1
it	0
is	0
all	0
they	0

Even	0
when	0
you	0
can	0
say	0
that	0
you	0
realize	0
it	0
is	0
a	0
problem	1
you	0
still	0
don’t	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
stop	0
it	0
because	0
you	0
never	0
learned	0
any	0

Something	0
that	0
took	0
a	0
lifetime	0
to	0

Be	0

with	0

a	0

therapist. 	0
You	0

when	0

The	0
concern	0
that	0
I	0
can	0
hear	0
in	0

that	0
the	0

that	0
can	0

a	0
problem	1

First	0
thing	0
I'd	0
suggest	0
is	0
getting	0
the	0
sleep	0
you	0

it	0

what	0

Family	0
support	0
is	0
very	0
helpful	0
when	0
having	0
these	0

 I	0
suggest	0
looking	0
for	0
therapist	0
within	0
reach	0
(school	1

the	0
community	1
calling	0

 Once	0
you	0

come	0
in	2
 	0
I	0
have	0
found	0
trough	0

that	0
once	0
they	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
chance	0
they	0
open	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
process	0
of	0
learning	0
and	0
healing. 	0
I	0
also	0
understand	0
that	0
parents	0
may	0
become	0
overly	0
concerned	0
and	0
overprotective	0
when	0
hearing	0
about	0
your	0
symptoms	1

that’s	0
why	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
discuss	0
them	0
with	0
a	0

normalize	0

In	0

have	0
always	0
worked	0
in	0

with	0
the	0
following	0
slogan	0
(if	0
you	0

that	0
I	0
learned	0
years	0
ago	0
during	0
graduate	0
school:	0
"Not	0
every	0

is	0
good	0
for	0
every	0
client	1
and	0
not	0
every	0
client	0
is	0
good	0
for	0
every	0
therapist."	0
It	0
is	0
perhaps	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
guiding	0
views	0
I	0
hold	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
clients	2
The	0
therapeutic	0
relationship	0
is	0
driven	0
by	0
mutuality	0
-	0
the	0
desire	0
of	0
the	0
client	0
to	0
get	0
better	0
at	0
living	0
life	1
and	0
the	0
therapist's	0
desire	0
to	0
truly	0
see	0
the	0
client	0
heal	0
and	0
grow	2
When	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
block	0
in	0
this	0
process	0
from	0
either	0
side	0
that	0
prevents	0
that	0
synergy	0
from	0
occurring	1
the	0
relationship	0
that	0
should	0
be	0
established	0
may	0
not	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
form	2
Or	1
if	0
already	0
formed	1
may	0
at	0
some	0
point	0
be	0
unable	0
to	0
move	0
forward	2
In	0
these	0
instances	1
referring	0
the	0
client	0
to	0
another	0
type	0
of	0
service	0
or	0
clinician	0
is	0
appropriate	2
Usually	1
this	0
can	0
be	0
seen	0
pretty	0
quickly	0
by	0
either	0
party	1
though	0
sometimes	0
it	0
is	0
not	0
always	0
clear.Ultimately	1
the	0
client	0
and	0
counselor	0
need	0
to	0
work	0
together	0
to	0
discover	0
if	0
the	0
needs	0
of	0
the	0
client	0
(which	0
is	0
paramount)	0
are	0
being	0
met	0
in	0
the	0
therapeutic	0
engagement	0
with	0
their	0
current	0
counselor	1
or	0
if	0
other	0
arrangements	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
made	0
to	0
go	0
elsewhere	2
If	0
both	0
are	0
observant	0
in	0
this	0

they	0
can	0
work	0
together	0
to	0
maintain	0
that	0
sacred	0
space	0
and	0
continue	0
to	0
reach	0
the	0
goals	0
that	0
have	0
been	0
set	2
Eventually	1
therapy	0
will	0
end	1
but	0
hopefully	0
based	0
on	0
the	0
client's	0
successful	0
journey	0
to	0
the	0
place	0
where	0
they	0
wanted	0
to	0
go	1

thus	0
opening	0
the	0
next	0

that	0

As	0
a	0
relationship	0
therapist	0
I	0
work	0
with	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
who	0
feel	0
similar	0
feelings	0
to	0
some	0
degree	0
or	0
another	0
and	0
almost	0
always	0
find	0
that	0
the	0
origin	0
of	0
these	0
feelings	0
point	0
back	0
towards	0
childhood. How	0
did	0
you	0
caregivers	0
express	0
(or	0
not	0
express)	0
love	0
towards	0
you	3
How	0
did	0
they	0
express	0
(or	0
not	0
express)	0
love	0
towards	0
one	0
another	2
These	0
early	0
messages	0
become	0
your	0
template	0
for	0
how	0
you	0
have	0
learned	0
to	0
see	0
yourself	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
expect	0
from	0
others. In	0
his	0
book Wired	0
for	0
Love, Stan	0
Tatkin	1
PsyD	0
writes “We	0
learn	0
to	0
love	0
ourselves	0
precisely	0
because	0
we	0

Being	0
involved	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
a	0
partner who	0
does	0
the	0
behaviors you	0
describe	0
can	0
be	0
incredibly	0
difficult	1
and	0
many	0
would	0
argue	0
is	0
even	0
harder	0
than overcoming	0
actual	0
physical	0
violence	2
I	0
was	0
a	0
little	0
confused	0
about	0
whether	0
you're	0
are	0
still	0
broken	0
up	0
with	0
this	0
person	0
or	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
still	0
thinking	0
about	0
it	2
I	0
am	0
going	0
to	0
assume	0
you	0
are	0
still	0
undecided	2
Some	0
of	0
the	0
things	0
you	0
are	0
describing	0
sound	0
like	0
emotional	0
abuse	2
Even	0
without	0
physical	0
abuse	1
being	0
emotionally	0
abused	0
can	0
still	0
be	0
traumatizing	2
When	0
partners	0
question	0
and	0
accuse	1
they	0
are	0
often	0
trying	0
to	0
exercise	0
power	0
and	0
control	0
over	0
their	0
partners	0
by	0
hurting	0
them	0
with	0
unfounded	0
accusations. 	0
The	0
accusations	0
serve	0
to	0
make	0
someone	0
feel	0
guilty and	0
to	0
manipulate	0
them	2
For	0
example	1
if	0
your	0
partner	0
accuses	0
you	0
of	0
cheating	0
when	0
you	0
go	0
out	0
bowling	0
with	0
friends	1
you	0
may	0
elect	0
not	0
to	0
go	0
bowling	0
just	0
to	0
satisfy	0
your	0
partner	0
and	0
prevent	0
a	0
fight	0
from	0
occurring	2
The	0
person	0
being	0
accused	0
or	0
questioned	0
often	0
tries to	0
prove	0
over	0
and	0
over	0
again	0
that	0
they	0
have	0
done	0
nothing	0
wrong	1
but	0
it	0
doesn't	0

And	0
that	0
brings	0

point	0
of	0
what	0
some	0

in	0

And	0
from	0
my	0

I	0
can	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0

even	0
ONE	0

willing	0
to	0
make	0
some	0
small	0

can	0
often	0
ripple	0
outward	0

the	0

bring	0
about	0

outcomes! So	0
my	0
encouragement	0
to	0
you	0
is	0
this	0

if	0
you're	0

him	0
what	0

it	0
scares	0
them. 	0
They	0
see	0
someone	0
they	0
love	0
behaving	0

frightening	0
ways. 	0
That's	0
a	0
good	0
reason	0
to	0
want	0
to	0
manage	0
your	0
emotions	0
differently...but 	0
what	0
are	0
your	0
thoughts	0
on	0
your	0
anger? 	0
Do	0
you	0
think	0
your	0
angry	0
feelings	0
justify	0
lashing	0
out?  The	0
thing	0
is	0
that	0
feeling	0
angry	0
is	0
just	0
that...feeling. 	0
Acting	0
out	0
is	0
behavior	0
and	0
that	0

everyone	0
around	0

Do	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
manage	0
your	0
behavior	1
as	0
well	0
as	0
your	0
feelings? 	0
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
do.First	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
pay	0
better	0
attention	0
to	0
your	0
feelings	0
"thermostat". 	0
If	0
you	0
are	0
always	0
near	0
"boiling"	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
much	0
margin	0
for	0
error. 	0
It's	0
in 	0
your	0
best	0
interest	1
and 	0
that	0
of	0
your	0
family	1
to	0
bring	0
that	0
temperature	0
down. 	0
That	0
may	0
mean	0
more	0
physical	0
activity	1
meditation	1
journaling	0
or	0
some	0
other	0
outlet.The	0
next	1
and	0
bigger	1
question	0
is	0
what	0
are	0
you	0
so	0
mad	0
about? 	0
Or	0
are	0
you	0
really	0
sad	1
scared	1
confused? 	0
Anger	0
is	0
a	0
secondary	0
emotion	1
much	0
like	0
pneumonia	0
is	0
a	0
secondary	0
infection. 	0
Anger	1
which	0
sets	0
us	0
up	0
to	0
defend	0
ourselves	0
against	0
a	0
perceived	0
danger	1
is	0
often	0
a	0
cover	0
for	0
feelings	0
that	0
leave	0
us	0
more	0
vulnerable. 	0
That	0
means	0
people	0
who	0
are	0
grieving	0
may	0
exhibit	0
rage;	0
people	0
who	0
are	0
scared	0
may	0
lash	0
out.That	0
doesn't	0
excuse	0
bad	0

it	0

it	2

you	0

your	0

more	0
often	0
than	0
you	0

the	0
case	1

try	0
understanding	0
the	0

behind	0
your	0

it	0
because	0
you	0

of	0
someone	0

 One	0
general	0

you're	0
not	0
very	0
familiar	1
probably	0
your	0
fear	0
will	0
decrease.The	0
other	0
general	0
direction	0
to	0
understand	0
is	0
if	0
in	0
your	0

The	0
first	0
step	0
to	0
change	0
is	0
to	0
admit	0
that	0
you	0

that	0
is	0
in	0

of	0
change	2
 Frequently	0

to	0
me	0
that	0
you	0

that	0
you	0
can	0
not	0
do	0
this	0
alone	2
 The	0
best	0
course	0
of	0
treatment	0
for	0
you	0
is	0
to	0
treat	0
all	0
of	0
these	0
problems	0
together	2
 Alcohol	0
detox	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
dangerous	0
so	0
it	0
is	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
do	0
this	0
under	0
the	0
supervision	0
of	0
a	0
medical	0
provider;	0
preferably	0
someone	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
addiction	2
 Know	0
also	0
that	0

appear	0
to	0
be	0
as	0
big	0
as	0
a	0

as	0

is	1
it	0
will	0
cause	0
you	0
to	0
have	0
an	0
increase	0
in	0
alcohol	0
cravings	0
so	0
complete	0
abstinence	0
from	0
drugs	0
and	0
alcohol	0
is	0
needed. I	0
really	0
recommend	0
an	0
inpatient	0
stay	0
for	0
at	0
least	0
30	0
days	0
for	0
anyone	0
who	0
is	0

not	2
 If	0
this	0
is	0
not	0
a	0
possibility	1
then	0
the	0
next	0
best	0
thing	0
would	0
be	0
an	0
Intensive	0
outpatient	0
program	0
that	0
treats	0
both	0
addiction	0

mental	0
health	0
issues	2
 Know	0
that	0
there	0
is	0

for	0
what	0
you	0

 You	0
can	0
get	0
control	0
over	0
these	0

 The	0
next	0
step	0
is	0
finding	0
the	0
team	0
and/or	0
facility	0
that	0

going	0
to	0

Great	0
question	2
The	0
decision	0
to	0
pursue	0
therapy	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
very	0
difficult	0
one	0
and	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
there	0
seem	0
to	0
be	0
so	0
many	0
profiles	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
wade	0
through	0
can	0
be	0
particularly	0
daunting	2
Here's	0
what	0
I	0
suggest	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
process	0
a	0
bit	0
easier: 1)	0
Narrow	0
down	0
your	0
preferred	0
geographical	0
area	2
Are	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
rural	1
suburban	1
or	0
urban	0
environment	3
If	0
it's	0
either	0
of	0
the	0
latter	0
two	1
you'll	0
probably	0
have	0
a	0
mental	0
health	0
professional	0
close	0
by	2
Decide	0
now	0
if	0
it's	0
important	0
to	0
you	0
that	0
their	0
office	0
be	0
within	0
walking	0
or	0
short	0
driving	0
distance. 2)	0
Decide	0
if	0
you	0
need	0
it	0
to	0
be	0
covered	0
by	0
your	0
insurance	2
You'll	0
have	0
more	0
options	0
if	0
you're	0
willing	0
to	0
pay	0
out	0
of	0
pocket	0
and	0
get	0
reimbursed	0
by	0
your	0
insurance	1
but	0
more	0
and	0
more	0
people	0
are	0
accepting	0
insurance	0
these	0
days. 3)	0
Find	0
someone	0
whose	0
profile	0
has	0
the	0
key	0
words	0
that	0
you're	0
looking	0
for	2
If	0
you're	0
struggling	0
with	0
traumatic	0

make	0
sure	0
they	0
have	0
"trauma"	0
or	0
something	0
along	0
those	0
lines	0
in	0
their	0

Make	0
sure	0
they	0
have	0
a	0
friendly	0
and	0
professional	0
picture	2
This	0
is	0
small	1

this	0
detail	0
shows	0
that	0
they	0
really	0
care	0
about	0
how	0
they	0
present	0
to	0
the	0
world. 5)	0
Come	0
up	0
with	0
a	0
list	0
of	0
about	0
3	0
people	0
and	0
rank	0
them	0
from	0
most	0
appealing	0
to	0

Set	0
up	0
an	0
appointment	0
with	0
the	0
person	0
who	0
seems	0
like	0
the	0
best	0
fit	0
and	0
give	0
it	0
a	0
try	0
for	0
the	0
first	0
session	2
You'll	0
know	0
by	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
it	0
if	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
fit.It	0
can	0
be	0

model	0
developed	0
by	0
Albert	0
Ellis	1
the	0
founder	0
of	0
Rational	0
Emotive	0
Behavior	0
Theory	2
The	0
theory	0
basically	0
states	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
not	0
control	0
an	0
event	0
but	0
you	0
can	0
control	0
your	0
reaction	0
to	0
the	0
emotions	0
associated	0
with	0
said	0
event	2
For	0
instance	0
here	0
is	0
an	0
example:A	0
(Action	0
or	0
Event):	0
You	0
need	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
someone	0
and	0
that	0
person	0
is	0
not	0
calling	0
you	0
back.B	0
(Behavior	0
or	0
Response):	0
You	0
begin	0
to	0
tell	0
yourself	0
that	0
this	0
person	0
is	0
too	0
busy	0
for	0
me	0
or	0
I	0
am	0
not	0

this	0
person.C	0
(Consequence):	0
You	0

you	0
look	0
at	0
the	0
model	1
B	0
has	0
a	0
direct	0
effect	0
on	0
C	2
The	0
thought	0
is	0
if	0
you	0
change	0
your	0
reaction	0
to	0
A	1
then	0
C	0
will	0
have	0
a	0
better	0
consequence	1
such	0
as:A:	0
stays	0
the	0
same.B	0
(this	0
is	0
what	0
you	0
change):	0
This	0
person	0
must	0
be	0
busy	1
they	0
will	0
call	0
me	0
back	0
when	0
they	0
get	0
a	0

I	0

your	0

The	0

we	0
may	0
remain	0
stuck	0
and	0
it	0
may	0
make	0
it	0
hard	0
to	0
move	0
on	2
So	0
in	0
some	0
ways	1
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
move	0
on	0
too	0
soon	0
by	0
just	0
trying	0
to	0
ignore	0
your	0
feelings	2
Instead	1
take	0
good	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	1
talk	0
to	0
friends	0
and	0
give	0
your	0
self	0
time	0
to	0
heal	2
The	0
second	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
is	0
to	0
forgive	0
yourself;	0
this	0
is	0
also	0
an	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	2
You	0
might	0
be	0
blaming	0
yourself	0
and	0
re-living	0
moments	0
when	0
you	0
wish	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
done	0
things	0
differently	2
By	0
replaying	0
those	0
thoughts	0
you	0
remain	0
stuck	2
When	0
we	0
begin	0
to	0
forgive	0
ourselves	1
we	0
truly	0
begin	0
to	0
heal	2
Lastly	1
in	0
my	0
experience	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
the	0
most	0
difficulty	0
moving	0
on	0
have	0
not	0
really	0
severed	0
all	0
ties	0
with	0
their	0
ex	2
They	0
are	0
still	0
following	0
them	0
on	0
social	0
media	0
or	0
even	0
checking	0
in	0
with	0
texts	2
This	0
is	0
probably	0
the	0
hardest	0
part	0
for	0
some	0
people	1
but	0
to	0
move	0
forward	0
there	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
clear	0
boundary	0
and	0
a	0
clear	0
ending	2
If	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
clear	0
ending	1
you	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
new	0
beginning	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps	2
Take	0
good	0
care	0

This	0

a	0

how	0

this	3
If	0
it's	0
more	0
than	0
a	0
5/10	1
I	0
would	0
definitely	0
recommend	0
talking	0
with	0
a	0

The	0
short	0

A	0

congratulations	0
on	0

You	0
are	0
in	0
a	0
unique	0
place	2
So	0
few	0
have	0
reached	0
that	0
level	2
You	0
should	0
give	0
yourself	0
a	0
pat	0
on	0
the	0
back.Confidence	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
that	0
comes	0
naturally	2
But	0
can	0
and	0
does	0
come	0
with	0
practice.Having	0
gone	0
through	0
two	0
masters	0
programs	0
I	0
can	0
sympathize	0
with	0
your	0
your	0
dilemma. So	0
how	0
is	0
the	0
stress	0
affecting	0
you?Is	0
it	0
serious	0
enough	0
to	0
stop	0
you	0
from	0
presenting	0
or	0
is	0
it	0
just	0
"butterflies"?There	0
are	0
many	0
ways	0
of	0
dealing	0
with	0
the	0
anxiety	0
and	0
stress	2
Much	0
depends	0
on	0
how	0
serious	0
the	0
stress	0
is.So	0
here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
ideas:1	2
Practice	0
in	0
front	0
of	0
a	0
mirror.Sounds	0
strange	0
but	0
the	0
practice	0
helps.2	2
Ask	0
some	0
friends	0
to	0
listen	0
to	0
your	0
presentations. Not	0
so	0
much	0
for	0
their	0
input	0
as	0
to	0
just	0
get	0
used	0
to	0
presenting.3	2
Focus	0
on	0
the	0
material	0
you	0
are	0
presenting. The	0
subject	0
matter	0
is	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
to	0

across	2
Step	0
away	0
from	0
your	0

get	0
into	0
the	0
facts	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
present	2
Let	0
the	0
material	0
you	0
present	0
be	0
the	0
focus. 4	2
Remember	0
everyone	0
else	0
is	0
just	0
as	0
nervous	0
as	0
you. Share	0
your	0
fears	0
with	0
some	0
of	0
your	0
classmates	0
and	0
gain	0
support	0
from	0
them	2
Focus	0

"Fake	0
it	1
till	0
you	0
make	0
it". Yes	0
it	0
sounds	0
blunt. But	0
sometimes	0
that's	0
what	0
it	0
takes	2
Even	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
it	1
you	0
won't	0
die.So	0
much	0
more	0
can	0

Congratulations	0
you	0
have	0
done	0
great	0
work	0
so	0
far	2
It's	0
just	0
one	0
step	0
at	0
a	0
time	1
take	0
the	0
steps	2
since	0
you	0
realize	0
your	0
sense	0
of	0
trust	0
was	0
broken	1
withdrawing	0
from	0
close	0
relationships	1
makes	0
sense.This	0
may	0
be	0
your	0
Self	0
giving	0
you	0
natural	0
time	0
to	0
recuperate	0
from	0
emotional	0
pain.Also	0
it	0
is	0
your	0
chance	0
to	0
think	0
over	0
how	0
to	0
handle	0
yourself	0
differently	0
in	0
future	0
relationships.Maybe	0
this	0
process	0
requires	0
more	0
time	0
than	0
you'd	0
like.Having	0
patience	0
is	0
very	0
difficult	0
when	0
a	0
person	0
feels	0
hurt.A	0
therapist	0
of	0
your	0
own	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
so	0
you	0
have	0
someone	0
for	0
guidance	0
and	0
to	0
chart	0
your	0
progress	0
w	0
you.This	0
may	0
feel	0
less	0
lonely	0
and	0
help	0
you	0
tolerate	0
the	0
waiting	0
period	0
till	0
you're	0
better	0
Ideally	1
termination	0
should	0
be	0
a	0
mutual	0
process	2
It's	0
not	0
that	0
the	0
therapist	0
kicks	0
the	0
client	0
out	0
at	0
some	0
point	0
and	0
says	1
"Okay	1
you're	0
done."	0
Rather	1
over	0
time	0
the	0
client	0
will	0
decrease	0
the	0
frequency	0
with	0
which	0
he/she	0
comes	0
to	0
session	0
so	0
that	0
it	0
may	0
start	0
off	0
as	0
weekly	1
then	0
decrease	0
to	0
biweekly	1
then	0
perhaps	0
once	0
every	0
three	0
weeks	1
then	0
once/month	0
and	0
so	0
on	2
Throughout	0
this	0
process	1
the	0
therapist	0
and	0
client	0
should	0
have	0
had	0
regular	0
check	0
ins	0
about	0
progress	0
toward	0
goals	2
If	0
the	0
client	0
feels	0
good	0
about	0
where	0
he/she	0
is	0
in	0
life	1
he/she	0
might	0
decide	0
to	0
suspend	0
therapy	0
for	0
now	2
That	0
being	0
said	1
the	0
therapist	0
should	0
make	0
it	0
very	0
clear	0
that	0
if	0
the	0
client	0
ever	0
decided	0
to	0
return	0
for	0
"maintenance"	0
therapy	0
or	0
a	0
check	0
in	1
he/she	0
would	0
always	0
be	0
welcome. There	0
is	0
no	0
hard	0
and	0
fast	0
rule	0
to	0
ending	0
or	0
a	0
particular	0
time	0
period	0
in	0
which	0
it	0
must	0
end	2
What	0
matters	0
most	0
is	0
that	0
the	0
client	0
feels	0
good	0
about	0
it	0
and	0
knows	0
that	0
the	0
therapist	0
will	0
always	0
be	0
there	0
should	0
he/she	0
wish	0
to	0
return	2
What's	0
most	0
important	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
recognize	0
that	0
what	0
you've	0
been	0
doing	0
is	0
off	0
base	0
-	0
that	0
what	0
you've	0
been	0
feeling	0
is	0
"overreacting,"	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
"insecurities,"	0
and	0
you	0
suspect	0
your	0
actions	0

reactions	0
are	0

your	0
own	0
past	0
and	0
not	0
to	0
the	0
current	0
situation	0
or	0
to	0
your	0
partner	2
That's	0
an	0
excellent	0
first	0
step	0
because	0
without	0
recognizing	0
these	0
things	0
about	0
yourself	1
it's	0
unlikely	0
that	0
you	0
would	0
change.That	0

if	0
you	0
are	0
really	0
ready	0
to	0
start	0
some	0
therapy	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
your	0
own	0
personal	0
growth..	2
not	0
because	0
there	0
is	0
something	0
"wrong"	0
with	0
you	1

because	0
you're	0

we	0

of	0
the	0

when	0

the	0
counseling	2
I	0
don't	0

just	0
show	0
up	0

to	0
the	0

for	0
45-50	0

that	0

the	0
issues	0
that	0
brought	0
them	0
to	0
counseling	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	2
This	0
requires	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
vulnerable	1
capable	0
of	0
moving	0
past	0
your	0

measures	0
of	0
showing	0

In	0

the	0

Well	1
there	0
is	0
some	0
good	0
news	0
and	0
not-so-good	0
news	2
The	0
good	0
news	0
is	0
that	0
people	0
are	0
capable	0
of	0
moving	0
on	0
from	0
relationships	1
even	0
if	0
the	0
person	0
showed	0
them	0
a	0
sort	0
of	0
love	0
that	0
they've	0
never	0
felt	0
they've	0
had	1
or	0
deserved	1
before	2
Sometimes	1
even	0
just	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
this	0
has	0
happened	0
for	0
them	0
can	1
eventually	0
(see	0
below)	0
lead	0
them	0
to	0
seek	0
out	0
love	0
again	1
because	0
they	0
now	0
believe	0
they	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
have	0
that	0
again.So	1
the	0
not-so-good	0
news	0
though	0
is	0
that	0
one	0
can	0
not	0
"just	0
move	0
on."	0
I'd	0
even	0
venture	0
to	0
say	0
that	0
the	0
pressure	0
you	0
may	0
be	0
putting	0
on	0
yourself	0
to	0
just	0
move	0
on	0
and	0
out	0
of	0
this	0
yucky	0
hole	0
of	0
feelings	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
is	0
actually	0
too	0
much	0
pressure	0
and	0
adding	0
to	0
the	0
yucky	0
feelings	0
as	0
they	0
are	2
Instead	1
try	0
thinking	0
of	0
getting	0
past	0
these	0
feelings	0
as	0
grieving	0
over	0
the	0
loss	0
of	0
someone	0
(even	0
though	0
someone	0
didn't	0
die	1
there	0
is	0
still	0
a	0
significant	0
loss	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing)	0
and	0
therefore	0
how	0
essential	0
it	0
is	0
to	0
allow	0
yourself	0
to	0
grieve	1
to	0
feel	0
whatever	0
feelings	0
(of	0
anger	1
or	0
sadness	1
or	0
something	0
else)	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	2
Often	1
it	0
is	0
really	0
helpful	0
to	0
speak	0
those	0
feelings	0
(I	0
recommend	0
professionals	0
in	0
this	0
case)	0
who	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
pathological	0
for	0
this	0
struggle	1
and	0
instead	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
completely	0
normal	2
Love	0
is	0
a	0
crazy	0
thing	1
and	0
the	0
feelings	0
can	0
get	0
very	0
confusing	2
But	1
the	0
last	0
stage	0
of	0
grieving	0
is	0
"acceptance,"	0
and	0
it	0
is	0
very	0
challenging	0
to	0
get	0
there	0
if	0
you	0
skip	0
over	0
denial	1
anger	1
bargaining	1
and	0
depression	2
Wow	0
what	0
a	0
painful	0
journey	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
in	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	2
Death	0
and	0
grief	0
bring	0
up	0
so	0
many	0
painful	0
reminders	0
of	0
relationships--what	0
they	0
could	0
have	0
been	1
never	0
were	1

what	0

With	0

the	0

often	0

your	0

he	0

We	0

hope	0
this	0
offers	0
you	0
some	0
nuggets	0
of	0
helpfulness!	0
It's	0
very	0
admirable	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
stop	0
smoking	0
for	0
the	0
sake	0
of	0
your	0
health	0
and	0
your	0
child's	0
health. 	0
The	0
mental	0
aspect	0
of	0
quitting	0
a	0
drug	0
can	0
and	0
usually	0
is	0
the	0
hardest	0
part. 	0
First	1
it	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
change	0
the	0
focus	0
of	0
your	0
thinking	0
so	0
you	0
are	0
focusing	0
on	0
the	0
healthy	0
behaviors	0
you	0
will	0
start/improve	0
rather	0
than	0
only	0
focusing	0
on	0
the	0
behavior	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
stop. 	0
The	0
reason	0
for	0
this	0
is	0
that	0
our	0
brains	0
hear	0
the	0
main	0
topic	0
of	0
our	0
thoughts. 	0
That	0
is	1
when	0
you	0
tell	0
yourself	0
"quit	0
smoking	1
quit	0
smoking	1
quit	0
smoking"	1
your	0
brain	0
hears	0
"smoking	1
smoking	1
smoking". 	0
So	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
put	0
together	0
a	0
self-care	0
plan	0
that	0
addresses	0
your	0
thinking	1
emotions	1
and	0
behaviors	0
(nutrition	1
physical	0
activity	1
and	0
other	0
stress	0
reducing	0
activities). 	0
The	0
idea	0
is	0
to	0
have	0
an	0
effective	0
plan	0
in	0
place	0
to	0
both	0
prevent	0
yourself	0
from	0
feeling	0
intense	0
stress	0
(which	0
increases	0
cravings)	0
and	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
well-placed	0
plan	0
for	0
when	0
the	0
intense	0
cravings	0
inevitably	0
present	0
themselves. 	0
And	0
lastly	1
and	0
possibly	0
the	0
most	0
important;	0
You	0
have	0
to	0
believe	0
you	0
deserve	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
healthiest	0
version	0
of	0
yourself. 	0
Think	0
about	0
the	0
times	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
most	0
vulnerable	0
to	0
smoke	0
(stressful	0
situations	1
after	0
meals	1
when	0
drinking	1
social	0
situations	1
etc.). 	0
The	0
use	0
of	0
affirmations	0
is	0
also	0
an	0
important	0
resource	0
as	0
what	0
we	0
say	0
to	0
ourselves	0
effects	0
our	0
mood. 	0
Repeatedly	0
telling	0
yourself	0
"i	0
am	0
healthy	1
"i	0
am	0
getting	0
healthier	1
"my	0
lungs	0
are	0
becoming	0
clear	0
and	0
healthy"	0
or	0
other	0
affirmations	0
like	0
this. 	0
Even	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
believe	0
them	0
at	0
first	1
continue	0
saying	0
them. 	0
This	0
step	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
improve	0
cognitive	0
flexibility	0
which	0
trains	0
your	0
brain	0
to	0
be	0
open	0
to	0
change. 	0
Think	0
about	0
activities	0
that	0
you	0
like	0
to	0
do	0
or	0
that	0
you	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
replace	0
smoking	0
with	0
those	0
activities. 	0
Any	0
activity	0
that	0
can	0
make	0
you	0
laugh	0
(time	0
with	0
friends	1
watching	0
comedies	1
etc.)	0
will	0
evoke	0
a	0
calming	0
response	0
because	0
when	0
we	0
feel	0
happy	1
we	0
typically	0
don't	0
feel	0
stressed	0
out	0
simultaneously	2
You	0
felt	0
bad	0
when	0
you	0
lied	1
so	0
you	0
told	0
the	0
truth. 	0
I	0
imagine	0
your	0
mom	0
was	0
really	0
shocked	0
and	0
upset	0
-	0
both	0
of	0
those	0
things	0
tell	0
me	0
you	0
are	0
a	0
pretty	0
honest	0
person. 	0
It's	0
possible	0
that	0
your	0
mom	0
had	0
a	0
big	0
reaction	0
simply	0
because	0
she	0
has	0
learned	0
that	0
her	0
child	1
from	0
whom	0
she	0
always	0
assumed	0
honesty	1
was	0
capable	0
of	0
being	0
dishonest. 	0
That's	0
not	0
awesome	1
but	0
it's	0
not	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
the	0
world. 	0
You	0
made	0
a	0
mistake	0
-	0
you'll	0
make	0
more	0
of	0
those	0
in	0
your	0
life	1
just	0
try	0
not	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
same	0
ones	0
over	0
and	0
over	0
again.It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
mom	0
are	0
close	0
so	0
I	0
can	0
see	0
why	0
it	0
would	0
feel	0
so	0
awful	0
to	0
have	0
her	0
distrust	0
you. 	0
Since	0
you	0
are	0
a	0
fundamentally	0
honest	0
person	1
the	0
way	0
back	0
to	0
being	0
trusted	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
simple	1
but	0
may	0
take	0
a	0
little	0
time. 	0
The	0
"recipe"	0
is	0
easy	0
-	0
say	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
doing/going	0
to	0
do;	0
do	0
only	0
that	0
unless	0
change	0
is	0
necessary	1
in	0
which	0
case	0
you	0
inform	0
others	0
involved	1
and	0
repeat.  And	0
cut	0
yourself	0
some	0
slack. 	0
Your	0
mom	0
will	0
recover	0
and	0
so	0
will	0
you. 	0
It's	0
an	0
important	0
and	0
painful	0
lesson	0
about	0
integrity	1
but	0
once	0
learned	0
it	0
will	0
serve	0
you	0
well	2
There	0
are	0
never	0
"too	0
many	0
issues"	0
to	0
be	0
addressed	0
in	0
therapy. 	0
Most	0
people	0
come	0
in	0
with	0
multiple	0
issues	0
they	0
want	0
to	0
address. 	0
The	0
wonderful	0
thing	0
about	0
therapy	1
is	0
that	0
often	1
as	0
one	0
or	0
more	0
significant	0
issues	0
begin	0
to	0
change	0
and	0
improve- 	0
 the	0
lead	0
naturally	0
without	0
much	0
effort	0
to	0
improvements	0
in	0
the	0
other	0
areas. 	0
(For	0
example	1
as	0
you	0
begin	0
to	0
address	0
trauma	0
and	0
betrayal	0
from	0
you	0
past	1
you	0
may	0
find	0
that	0
the	0
insomnia	0
improves)	2
Your	0
therapist	1
with	0
you	0
input	0
and	0
direction	1
can	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
prioritize	0
which	0
problem	0
areas	0
to	0
target	0
first	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
aware	0
of	0
your	0
positive	0
traits	0
but	0
you are	0
struggling	0
with	0
someone	0
who	0
does	0
not	0
acknowledge	0
nor	0
celebrate	0
your	0
efforts	0
or	0
achievements.  	0
It	0
seems	0
like	0
that	0
is	0
affecting	0
your	0
inner	0
voice	1
which	0
allows	0
you	0
to	0
accept	0
yourself	0
for	0
who	0
you	0
are.My	0
suggestion	0
is	0
to	0
explore	0
that	0
relationship and	0
decide	0
if	0
that	0
person’s	0
opinion	0
should	0
determine	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
about	0
yourself	2
  If	0
this	0
is	0
an	0
important	0
relationship	1
you	0
could	0
communicate	0
to	0
this	0
person	0
how	0
the	0
lack	0
of	0
positive	0
feedback	0
is	0
affecting	0
you. 	0
Then	1
work	0
on	0
spending	0
more	0
time	0
with	0
those	0
who	0
value	0
you	1
and	0
can	0
give	0
you	0
praise	1
encouragement	1
and	0
constructive	0
criticism. 	0
Also	1
explore	0
your	0
religious	0
beliefs	1
and	0
what	0
is	0
they	0
say	0
about	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
as	0
a	0
person. 	0
Finally	1
explore	0
with	0
a	0
Counselor	0
your	0
inner	0
voice	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
if	0
the	0
negative	0
message	0
is	0
settling	0
in	0
and	0
harming	0
your	0
self-esteem.  	0
Through	0
therapy	1
you	0

self-compassion	0

Hi	0
there	2
Thank	0
you	0
reaching	0
out	0
for	0
help	2
It	0
takes	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
courage	0
for	0
someone	0
that	0
is	0
being	0
abused	0
to	0
reach	0
out	0
for	0
help	2
I	0
want	0
you	0
to	0
know	0
that	0
I	0
am	0
here	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
in	0
any	0
way	0
that	0
I	0
can. First	0
and	0
foremost	1
you	0
did	0
not	0
mention	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
you	0
had	0
children	0
yourself	0
by	0
this	0
man	2
I’m	0
going	0
to	0
assume	0
there	0
are	2
So	1
the	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
right	0
at	0
this	0
moment	0
is	0
asking	0
yourself	1
if	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
are	0
safe	3
Is	0
the	0
boyfriend	0
currently	0
living	0
in	0
the	0
home	0
or	0
is	0
he	0
coming	0
and	0
going	3
If	0
he	0
is	0
coming	0
and	0
going	0
or	0
currently	0
living	0
in	0
the	0
home	1
my	0
suggestion	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
is	0
to	0
pack	0
a	0
bag	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
and	0
go	0
somewhere	0
safe	0
(i.e	2
family	0
members	0
home	1
friend	0
or	0
a	0
shelter	0
temporarily)	2
I	0
cannot	0
stress	0
this	0
enough	2
Although	1
some	0
people	0
tend	0
to	0
minimize	0
their	0
abusers	0
behavior	0
(i.e	2
they	0
only	0
do	0
it	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
drinking	1
they	0
only	0
do	0
it	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
mad)	1
it’s	0
those	0
individuals	0
that	0
find	0
themselves	0
or	0
their	0
children	0
in	0
a	0
serious	0
situation	2
So	1
you	0
can	0
never	0
take	0
abuse	0
(physical	0
or	0
mental)	0
lightly	0
because	0
you	0
never	0
know	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
through	0
that	0
persons	0
mind	0
at	0
that	0
particular	0
time	2
It’s	0
always	0
better	0
to	0
be	0
safe	0
than	0
sorry. Secondly	1
it	0
will	0
not	0
be	0
safe	1
helpful	0
or	0
productive	0
to	0
attempt	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
the	0
abuser	0
about	0
your	0
relationship	2
Abusers	0
often	0
times	0
try	0
and	0
manipulate	0
you	0
into	0
staying	0
by	0
apologizing	0
or	0
attempting	0
to	0
justify	0
their	0
behaviors	2
This	0
is	0
the	0
time	0
you	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
see	0
a	0
magistrate	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
protective	0
order	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children.It’s	0
unfortunate	0
that	0
your	0
significant	0
other	0
was	0
involved	0
with	0
another	0
women	0
causing	0
pregnancy;	0
however	1
that	0
is	0
no	0
longer	0
your	0
concern	2
Your	0
concern	0
at	0
this	0
point	0
is	0
keeping	0
yourself	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
safe	2
I	0
would	0
also	0
suggest	0
counseling	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
work	0
through	0
these	0
issues	2
I	0

concerning	0

check	0
with	0
her	0

see	0
if	0

opportunity	0
with	0
the	0

In	0

Her	0

If	0
resources	0
in	0

I	0
would	0
seek	0
an	0
outside	0
therapist	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
children	0
your	0

can	0
benefit	0
from	0
a	0
therapeutic	0
relationship	0
outside	0
of	0

Once	0
you	0
have	0
plenty	0
of	0
feedback	0
from	0
her	0
teacher	0
and	0
a	0
therapist	0

then	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
determine	0
if	0
seeking	0

necessary	0
with	0
their	0

Thank	0
you	0

you	0
find	0
support	0
to	0

you	0

that	0
you	0
both	0

from	0
this	0

feel	0
a	0
little	0

all	0
it's	0
an	0
important	0
encounter	0
for	0
you	2
 My	0
suggestion	0

to	0

this	0
with	0
your	0

let	0
him/her	0
know	0
how	0
you're	0

Hi	0
Enid	1
You	0
sound	0
like	0
a	0
sensitive	0
parent;	0
I	0
like	0
that	0
you	0
talked	0
to	0
your	0
son	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
anything	0
is	0
wrong	2
There	0
is	0
some	0
key	0
information	0
here	0
(I	0
don't	0
know	0
your	0
son's	0
age	1
whether	0
he	0
spent	0
any	0
money	1
whether	0
he	0
put	0
the	0
card	0
back	1
or	0
how	0
many	0
times	0
he's	0
stolen)	1
and	0
my	0
answer	0
might	0
be	0
different	0
depending	0
on	0
those	0
details	1
but	0
I'll	0
give	0
you	0
my	0
thoughts.I	0
see	0
it	0
as	0
every	0
child's	0
job	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
the	0
rules	0
and	0
find	0
where	0
their	0
power	0
is	0
in	0
the	0
world	2
In	0
order	0
to	0
accomplish	0
that	1
many	0
of	0
them	0
test	0
limits	2
"What	0
can	0
I	0
get	0
away	0
with?"	0
is	0
a	0
question	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
answer	0
to	2
If	0
a	0
child	0
knows	0
the	0
rules	1
they're	0
much	0
more	0
likely	0
to	0
not	0
test	0
limits	0
(because	0
they	0
already	0
know	0
the	0
limits)	2
So	1
part	0
of	0
testing	0
limits	0
is	0
experimenting	0
with	0
stealing	0
and	0
lying	2
Not	0
all	0
kids	0
steal	1
but	0
I	0
would	0
say	0
pretty	0
much	0
every	0
child	0
lies	0
at	0
some	0
point	2
It's	0
a	0
normal	0
behaviour	1
and	0
most	0
of	0
the	0
time	0
it's	0
about	0
small	0
things	0
that	0
don't	0
matter	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
even	0
find	0
out. Stealing	0
a	0
debit	0
card	0
is	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
serious	1
and	0
I'm	0
not	0
surprised	0
he	0
lied	0
about	0
it	2
If	0
you	0
absolutely	0
know	0
that	0
he	0
took	0
it	1
it's	0
okay	0
to	0
tell	0
him	0
that	0
you	0
believe	0
he	0
did	0
this	0
thing	0
and	0
also	0
lied	0
about	0
it	2
It's	0
appropriate	0
to	0
give	0
a	0
consequence	0
for	0
this	0
type	0
of	0
behaviour	1
so	0
that	0
the	0
child	0
doesn't	0
do	0
it	0
again	2
The	0
consequence	0
should	0
be	0
as	0
natural	0
and	0
logical	0
as	0
possible	2
The	0
behaviour	0
(stealing)	0
was	0
harmful	0
to	0
you	1
so	0
doing	0
you	0
a	0
favour	0
with	0
extra	0
chores	0
might	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea. It's	0
funny	1
because	0
as	0
parents	0
we	0
try	0
to	0
tell	0
our	0
kids	0
that	0
lying	0
is	0
bad	1
but	0
they	0
know	0
they'll	0
get	0
a	0
consequence	0
if	0
they	0
tell	0
the	0
truth	0
so	0
there	0
are	0
natural	0
deterrents	0
to	0
being	0
honest	0
(we	0
don't	0
want	0
people	0
to	0
know	0
our	0
mistakes)	2
It's	0
a	0
dilemma	2
If	0
you	0
really	0
want	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
the	0
lying	0
part	1
you	0
can	0
tell	0
him	0
that	0
you	0
won't	0
give	0
him	0
a	0
consequence	0
for	0
the	0
lying	0
if	0
he	0
decides	0
to	0
come	0
clean	0
with	0
the	0
truth	0
within	0
one	0
day	2
That	0
gives	0
him	0
incentive	0
to	0
come	0
to	0
you	0
with	0
truth	2
It	0
sometimes	0
works	0
with	0
kids	0
to	0
give	0
them	0
a	0
chance	0
to	0
come	0
clean	0
and	0
then	0
reward	0
them	0
for	0
telling	0
the	0
truth. You	0
can	0
set	0
your	0
child	0
up	0
for	0
success	0
and	0
train	0
them	0
to	0
tolerate	0
honesty	2
Put	0
a	0
cookie	0
on	0
the	0
counter	2
Tell	0
your	0
child	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
cookie	0
at	0
some	0
point	0
in	0
the	0
day	2
Then	0
ask	0
them	0
later	0
if	0
they	0
took	0
the	0
cookie	2
You're	0
making	0
honesty	0
fun	2
Kids	0
love	0
games. Basically	1
there's	0
as	0
much	0
power	0
in	0
rewarding	0
the	0
positive	0
behaviour	0
as	0
punishing	0
the	0
negative. If	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
first	0
serious	0
offence	0
for	0
your	0
son	1
don't	0
make	0
a	0
big	0
deal	0
of	0
it;	0
consequence	0
him	0
and	0
see	0
if	0
he	0
learns	2
If	0
it's	0
a	0
pattern	1
that's	0
different	0
and	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
the	0
input	0
of	0
a	0
therapist	2
You	0
have	0
the	0
right	0
therapist	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
safe	0
with	0
that	0
person	2
Safety	0
consists	0
of	0
feeling	0
that	0
who	0
you	0
are	0

what	0
you	0
say	0
is	0
valued	2
The	0
right	0

is	0
not	0

'all	0

He	0

question	0

brief	1
so	0
I'll	0
just	0
try	0
to	0
give	0
general	0
answers	0
as	0
best	0
I	0
can	2
From	0
my	0
experiences	0
treating	0
many	0
people	0
with	0
your	0
boyfriend's	0
experiences	1
the	0
short	1
healthy	0
answer	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can't	0
fix	0
the	0
situation	0
and	0
maybe	0
not	0
even	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	2
He	0
needs	0
a	0
professional	2
Period. What	0
you	0
can do	1
is	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	2
With	0
his	0
background	1
it	0
is	0
not	0
likely	0
that	0
he	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
or	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
healthy	0
way	2
Your	0
task	0
needs	0
to	0
prioritize	0
your	0
own	0
safety	0
and	0
well-being	2
Trauma	0
and	0
substance	0
abuse	0
are	0
the	0
definition	0
of	0
being	0
out	0
of	0
control	1
unable	0
to	0
set	0
and	0
manage	0
appropriate	0
boundaries	1
manage	0
his	0
own	0
emotions	0
and	0
behaviors	2
So	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
is	0
unlikely	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
change	0
in	0
the	0
near-term	1
certainly	0
not	0
without	0
professional	0
help	2
You	0
might	0
also	0
benefit	0
from	0
help	0
and	0
support	1
to	0
understand	0
your	0
own	0
role	0
in	0
your	0
relationship	0
and	0
how	0
you	0
can	0
make	0
changes	0
in	0
your	0
life	2
I	0
am	0
NOT	0
blaming	0
you	0
for	0
any	0
aspect	0
of	0
your	0
boyfriend's	0
behavior	1
only	0
acknowledging	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
two	0
people	0
in	0
every	0
relationship	2
If	0
you	0
have	0
accepted	0
your	0
boyfriend's	0
drinking	0
and	0
violent	0
outbursts	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
(by	0
staying	0
in	0
the	0
relationship)	1
that	0
is	0
likely	0
to	0
perpetuate	0
his	0
behavior	2
And	0
there	0
isn't	0
any	0
way	0
to	0
"handle	0
violent	0
outbursts."	0
They	0
shouldn't	0
be	0
handled	0
at	0
all	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
away	0
from	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
during	0
his	0
outbursts	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
be	0
emotionally	0
and	0
physically	0
safe	1
then	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
what	0
you	0
will	0
have	0
to	0
do. We	0
can	0
never	0
really	0
change	0
anyone	0
else	2
The	0
only	0
person	0
we	0
can	0
change	0
is	0
ourselves	2
Sometimes	0
our	0
behavior	0
changes	0
the	0
odds	0
of	0
another	0
person's	0
behaviors	1
but	0
it	0
doesn't	0
control	0
it	2
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
that	0
you	0
work	0
with	0
a	0
professional	0
to	0
first	1
ensure	0
your	0
own	0
safety	0
above	0
all	2
Then	0
make	0
decisions	0
about	0
what	0
behavior	0
you	0
are	0
willing	0
to	0
accept	0

be	0
connected	0
to	1

which	0
you	0
want	0
to	0

Whatever	0
your	0

does	0
in	0

you	0
will	0

Let	0

some	0

It	0
can	0
be	0

get	0
counseling	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
supported	0
by	0
family	0

There	0
might	0
be	0
a	0
few	0
options. 	0
If	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
school	1
I'd	0
recommend	0
talking	0
to	0
a	0
school	0
counselor	0

They	0
often	0
will	0
be	0
able	0

resources	0
in	0
your	0

In	0

depending	0
on	0
where	0

it's	0
also	0
often	0
possible	0
to	0
call	0

Your	0

feelings.Blaming	0
you	0

unfair	0

not	0

to	0

what	0
you	0
write	1
you	0
did	0
nothing	0
wrong	0
and	0
your	0
action	0
toward	0
the	0
potential	0
suicider	0
was	0
gracious.My	0
only	0
guess	0
which	0
is	0
also	0
very	0
general	0
about	0
your	0
ex	0
bf's	0
behavior	0
is	0
that	0
he	0
doesn't	0
yet	0
fully	0
understand	0
himself	0
and	0
finds	0
blaming	0
others	0
easier	0
than	0
understanding	0
himself	2
Well	1
have	0
you	0
told	0
him	0
similar	0
descriptions	0
of	0
your	0
feelings	0
as	0
you	0
just	0
wrote	0
here?This	0
will	0
give	0
him	0
the	0
same	0
understanding	0
you're	0

us	0
to	0
have	0
here	0
on	0
this	0

in	0

that	0
the	0
best	1
the	0
amount	0

the	0
number	0
of	0
times	0
you	0
tell	0
your	0

some	0

with	0

  Another	0
path	0
to	0
open	0
is	0
to	0
ask	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
his	0
reason	0
to	0
feel	0
insecure	0
about	0
your	0
love	0
for	0
him	2
 This	0
may	0
open	0
a	0

discussion	0
about	0
what	0
he	0

Deciding	0

All	0

periods	0

one	0

people	0
may	0
feel	0
unhappy	0
in	0
the	0

normal. 	0
What	0
I	0
tell	0
my	0
clients	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
facing	0
this	0
decision	0

to	0
spend	0
some	0

your	0

What	0
do	0
you	0
feel	0
when	0
you	0
imagine	0
your	0

Do	0
you	0

When	0

Don't	0

Ask	0

some	0
of	0
the	0

Hi, Different	0
therapists	0
are	0
guided	0
by	0
the	0
ethical	0
guidelines	0
of	0
their	0
own	0
associations	0
or	0
colleges	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
receiving	0
gifts	1
so	0
this	0
may	0
differ	0
a	0
bit	0
from	0
therapist	0
to	0
therapist	2
It's	0
important	0
to	0
me	0
that	0
I	0
be	0
sensitive	0
to	0
cultural	0
norms	1
and	0
to	0
my	0
client's	0
needs	2
In	0
Canada	1
and	0
the	0
US	1
it	0
is	0
customary	0
for	0
people	0
to	0
sometimes	0
express	0
gratitude	0
with	0
a	0
small	0
gift	1
and	0
I	0
have	0
from	0
time	0
to	0
time	0
received	0
small	0
tokens	0
of	0
appreciation	0
because	0
I	0
believe	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
rude	0
to	0
refuse	0
this	2
It	0
is	0
never	0
necessary	0
to	0
give	0
a	0
therapist	0
a	0
gift	1
but	0
if	0
you	0
wish	0
to	0
express	0
your	0
gratitude	0
in	0
this	0
way	1
I	0
don't	0
think	0
it's	0
inappropriate	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
happy	0
with	0
the	0
person	0
that	0
you	0

about	0
to	0
be	0
married	0
to	0
and	0
are	0
also	0
enjoying	0

with	0
other	0

it	0
could	0
be	0
possible	0
that	0
you	0

more	0

one	0

any	0

such	0
as	0

I	0
don't	0
know	0
whether	0
your	0
use	0
of	0
the	0
phrase	0
"messing	0
around"	0
was	0
related	0
specifically	0
to	0
being	0
romantically	0

involved	0
with	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
you	0

if	0
you	0

that	0
you	0

with	0
them	2
These	0
terms	0
have	0
different	0
definitions	0
for	0
almost	0
everyone.I	0
would	0
definitely	0
recommend	0
speaking	0
with	0
a	0
local	0
mental	0

practitioner	0
in	0
your	0
area	1
not	0
because	0
there	0
is	0
anything	0
wrong	0
about	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
are	0

but	0
because	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
different	0
parts	0
of	0
what	0
is	0
happening	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
right	0
now	0
and	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
the	0
feelings	0

with	0
someone	0
who	0
can	0
help	0
you	0

and	0
the	0
people	0
are	0
most	0
important	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
(yourself	0

also	0

Hi	0
Lockport	1
Building	0
a	0
relationship	0
when	0
there	0
are	0
already	0
children	0
involved	0
is	0
very	0
tricky	2
You	0
don't	0
tell	0
us	0
whether	0
you	0
live	0
together	0
or	0
not	2
If	0
you	0
do	1
your	0
position	0
is	0
perhaps	0
more	0
difficult	1
because	0
his	0
daughter's	0
behaviours	0
affect	0
you;	0
you	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
home. A	0
bottom	0
line	0
for	0
me	0
is	0
you	0
don't	0
tell	0
someone	0
else	0
how	0
to	0
parent	2
That's	0
for	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
to	0
decide	2
When	0
he's	0
there	1
he's	0
the	0
parent	1
and	0
he	0
makes	0
the	0
decisions	0
about	0
how	0
she	0
is	0
disciplined	0
(or	0
not)	2
Even	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
good	0
ideas	0
or	0
you	0
completely	0
disagree	1
or	0
you	0
think	0
you	0
see	0
something	0
that	0
he's	0
not	0
seeing	1
it's	0
simply	0
not	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
interfere	0
there. It	0
sounds	0
like	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
is	0
struggling	0
emotionally	0
and	0
needs	0
support	2
He	0
has	0
had	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
losses	0
in	0
his	0
life	0
and	0
maybe	0
every	0
time	0
his	0
daughter	0
leaves	0
he	0
feels	0
powerless	0
and	0
abandoned	2
Do	0
you	0
talk	0
about	0
these	0
things	3
Can	0
you	0
find	0
that	0
line	0
of	0
supporting	0
him	0
but	0
not	0
telling	0
him	0
what	0
to	0
do?Although	0
I	0
suggest	0
you	0
leave	0
the	0
parenting	0
to	0
him	1
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
is	0
tell	0
him	0
what	0
you	0
see	1
offer	0
suggestions	0
if	0
he's	0
open	0
to	0
it	1
and	0
talk	0
about	0
the	0
ways	0
in	0
which	0
the	0
situation	0
affects	0
you	2
It	0
makes	0
sense	0
to	0
say	0
"I	0
see	0
you	0
struggling	0
and	0
I	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
help"	1
"I've	0
noticed	0
that	0
you	0
seem	0

discipline	0
her	2
Are	0
you	0
aware	0
that	0
it's	0
coming	0
across	0
this	0
way	3
Do	0
you	0
need	0
help?"	1
or	0
"I	0
feel	0
sad	0
and	0
frustrated	0
when	0
we	0
don't	0
spend	0
any	0
time	0
alone	0
together." You	0
sound	0
a	0
bit	0
resentful	0
of	0
his	0
daughter	2
Is	0
it	0
possible	0
that	0
your	0
real	0
struggle	0
is	0
about	0
whether	0
you're	0
ready	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
with	0
a	0
man	0

it's	0

to	0

let	0
him	0
know	0
how	0
you	0

accept	0
the	0

I	0

come	0

therapy	0
with	0
hesitations	0

be	0

with	0

where	0
most	0
people	0
fall	0
down..	2

when	0

down	1
pick	0

up..	2

back	0

:)	0
Conflict	0
is	0
a	0
tricky	0
beast	0
and	0
shows	0
up	0
in	0
every one	0
of	0
our	0
relationships. What	0
I'm	0
reading	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
yourself	0
in	0
a	0
loop	0
of	0
 seeking	0
validation	0
of	0
your	0
thoughts	0
and	0
feelings	0
from	0
your	0
friends	0
rather	0
than	0
validating	0
yourself	2
Am	0
I	0
right	3
If	0
you	0
aren't	0
validating	0
yourself	1
no	0
one	0
else	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
either	2
 Try	0
finding	0
a	0
small	0
nugget	0
of	0
truth	0
in	0
the	0
feedback	0
your	0
friends	0
give	0
you	1
this	0
will	0
help	0
to	0
lower	0
your	0
defenses	0
and	0
help	0
your	0
friends	0
hear	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
really	0
sharing	2
 And	0
then	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
still	0
feeling	0
vulnerable	1
share	0
that	0
too..	2
What	0
you	0
are	0
describing	0
is	0
a	0
state	0
of	0
abandonment	0
like	0
no	0
other;	0
a	0
direct	0
lack	0
of	0
respect	2
The	0
challenge	0
here	0
is:	0
you	0
cannot	0
control	0
another	0
person	0
no	0
matter	0
how	0
hard	0
you	0
try	2
The	0
only	0
person	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
control	0
of	0
is	0
yourself	2
So	0
then	0
the	0
question	0
that	0
this	0
reality	0
poses	0
is:	0
What	0
are	0
you	0
willing	0
to	0
change	3
If	0
you	0
love	0
yourself	0
and	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
tremendous	0
value	1
if	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
what	0
you	0
bring	0
to	0
a	0
relationship	0
and	0
that	0
you	0
deserve	0
respect	0
and	0
love	0
and	0
tenderness	1
then	0
you	0
will	0
get	0
to	0
a	0
point	0
where	0
you	0
will	0
settle	0
for	0
nothing	0
less	0
than	0
that	2
The	0
change	0
that	0
might	0
be	0
necessary	0
in	0
yourself	0
is	0
to	0
change	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
see	0
yourself	1
the	0
way	0
you	0
treat	0
yourself	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
accept	2
Your	0
husband	0
also	0
needs	0
to	0
change	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
something	0
only	0
he	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
himself	0
but	0
reaching	0
out	0
to	0
get	0
help	0
as	0
well	2
It	0
would	0
be	0
helpful	0
for	0
you	0
both	0
to	0
get	0
help	0
because	0
there	0
is	0
damage	0
on	0
both	0
parts	2
You	0
have	0
much	0
more	0
power	0
than	0
you	0
realize	0
and	0
talking	0
with	0
someone	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
hone	0
that	0
power	0
and	0
make	0
a	0
difference	0
in	0
your	0
own	0
life	2
Sometimes	1
the	0
difference/change	0
can	0
be	0
walking	0
away	0
from	0
a	0
bad	0
situation	0
or	0
it	0
can	0
simply	0
be	0
changing	0
your	0
attitude	0
and	0
raising	0
the	0
bar	2
Sometimes	0
our	0
loved	0
ones	0
come	0
with	0
us	0
on	0
the	0
elevation	1
and	0
sometimes	0
they	0
get	0
left	0
behind	2
 You	0
must	0
do	0
some	0
deep	0
introspection	0
through	0
therapy	0
to	0
get	0
to	0
the	0
point	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
answer	0
this	0
question	0
for	0
yourself	2
I'm	0
sorry	0
for	0
so	0
much	0
stress	0
in	0
your	0

about	0

Here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
reasons	0
for	0
this:	0
1	2
Making	0
a	0

a	0

they may	0
also use	0
some	0
type	0
of	0
screening	0
tool	1
assessment	0
or	0
scale	2
Many	0

have	0
similarities	0

someone	0
with	0
training	0
to	0
tease	0
out	0
the	0
differences	0
in	0
the	0
symptoms	2
2	2
Our	0
judgement	0

sometimes	0
off	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
assessing	0
ourselves	2
We	0
really	0

objective	2
Something	0
as	0

that	0
objectivity	2
In	0
addition	1
once	0

Sometimes	0
the	0

sorry	0
to	0

about	0
what	0

you!	0
What	0
you	0
are	0
describing	0
is	0
being	0
in	0
a	0
state	0
of	0
shock	2
You	0
haven't	0
suddenly	0
become	0
a	0
sociopath	0
-	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
normal	0
reaction	0
to	0
an	0
event	0
that	0
is	0
completely	0
overwhelming	2
There	0
are	0
most	0
likely	0
too	0
many	0
feelings	0
to	0
feel	0
right	0
now	1
so	0
your	0
body	0
in	0
its	0
wisdom	0
is	0
shutting	0
them	0
down	2
You	0
absolutely	0
can	0
recover	1
and	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
get	0
some	0
trauma	0
counseling	0
with	0
a	0
counselor	0
who	0
feels	0
safe	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
talk	0
with	2
This	0
is	0
not	0
the	0
kind	0
of	0
situation	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
handle	0
totally	0
on	0
your	0
own. 	0
I	0
think	0
it's	0
important	0
to	0
tease	0
more	0
of	0
this	0
situation	0
out	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
what	0
is	0
at	0
the	0
root	0
of	0
the	0
stress	2
It	0
is	0
emotionally	0
dangerous	0
to	0
be	0
at	0
a	0
job	0
for	0
a	0
lengthy	0
duration	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
feel	0
overworked	0
and	0
underpaid	2
You	0
will	0
not	0
perform	0
well	0
as	0
you	0
mention	1
and	0
thus	0
your	0
self-esteem	0
will	0
continually	0
take	0
a	0
hit	0
without	0
really	0
any	0
effort	2
So	1
I	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
simply	0
coping	0
with	0
your	0
stress	0
would	0
be	0
advisable	0
as	0
a	0
first	0
step.You	0
don't	0
speak	0
about	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
what	0
the	0
office	0
dynamics	0
are	0

which	0
can	0

for	0
me	0
of	0
what	0
can	0
be	0
done	0
to	0

I	0

up	0
about	0
your	0

Often	1
"overworked	0

also	0
includes	0
the	0
"my	0

that	0
can	0
demoralizing	2
If	0
we	0
feel	0
appreciated	1
that	0
can	0
go	0
a	0
long	0
way	2
I've	0
found	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
quite	0
common	0
for	0
bosses	0
to	0
require	0
some	0
instruction	0
for	0
how	0
to	0
show	0
each	0
of	0
their	0
employees	0
"appreciation"	0
(and	0
it	0
goes	0
deeper	0
than	0
"thank	0
you"	0
or	0
taking	0
you	0
out	0
to	0
lunch	0
-	0
it's	0
almost	0
something	0

made	0
explicit.)But	0
sometimes	0
appreciation	0
isn't	0
going	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
trick	0
either	2
Because	0
that	0
overworked	0
and	0
underpaid	0
actually	0
has	0
led	0
you	0
to	0
feel	0
"burnout."	0
You	0
have	0
zero	0
interest	0
in	0
doing	0
the	0
job	0
in	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
is	0
designed	1
so	0
some	0
real	0
changes	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
implemented. The	0
bottom	0
line	3
Try	0
not	0
to	0
just	0
"suck	0
it	0
up"	0
and	0
do	0
all	0
of	0
the	0
"self	0
care"	0
work	0
on	0
your	0
own	2
If	0
your	0
company	0
isn't	0
helping	0
you	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0
(I'm	0
talking	0
to	0
you	1
boss	0
that	0
handles	0
employee	0
pay	0
and/or	0
work	0
conditions!)	0
then	0
you	0
also	0
have	0
to	0
question	0
if	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
company	0
worth	0
working	0
for	2
While	0
I	0
don't	0
know	0
exactly	0
what	0
you	0
do	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
confidence	0
in	0
your	0
contributions!	0
So	0
take	0
that	0
confidence	0
to	0
a	0
tech	0
company	0
that	0
will	0
support	0
you	0
(and	0
there	0
are	0
tech	0
companies	0
out	0
there!)	0
I	0
would	0
look	0
at	0
 getting	0
engaged	0
with	0
a	0
support	0
network	0
of	0
individuals	0
who	0
may	0
also	0
have	0
autistic	0
children	2
 They	0
will	0
understand	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	0
at	0
home	0
and	0
you	0
may	0
also	0
find	0
someone	0
who	0
feels	0
that	0
same	0
way	0
as	0
you	2
If	0
you	0
have	0
not	0
sought	0
professional	0
counseling	0
for	0
the	0
abusive	0
relationship	0
I	0
would	0
seek	0
out	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
process	0
through	0
it	0
so	0
you	0
do	0
not	0
repeat	0
similar	0
choices	0
in	0
your	0
next	0
relationship	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
really	0
important	0
question	1
because	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
waste	0
your	0
time	0
and	0
money	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
is	0
not	0
a	0
good	0
fit	0
for	0
you. 	0
I	0
think	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
factor	0
that	0
makes	0
a	0
good	0
therapist	0
match	0
is	0
trust--	0
do	0
you	0
trust	0
this	0
person	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
meet	0
your	0
therapy	0
goals? 	0
There	0
are	0
few	0
things	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
upfront	0
to	0
test	0
this	0
out	1
without	0
spending	0
a	0
dime. 	0
First	1
ask	0
for	0
personal	0
recommendations	0
from	0
friends	0
or	0
others. 	0
If	0
you	0
know	0
someone	0
who	0
had	0
a	0
great	0
experience	0
with	0
a	0
certain	0
therapist	1
you'll	0
feel	0
more	0
confident	0
in	0
that	0
person	0
right	0
off	0
the	0
bat. 	0
Second	1
do	0
your	0
online	0
research. 	0
Google	0
the	0
person's	0
name	0
and	0
read	0
everything	0
you	0
can	0
find. 	0
Many	0
therapists	0
are	0
starting	0
to	0
develop	0
more	0
of	0
an	0
online	0
presence	0
because	0
they	0
know	0
that's	0
a	0
way	0
future	0
clients	0
can	0
develop	0
trust	0
without	0
even	0
stepping	0
in	0
their	0
door. 	0
See	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
a	0
blog	1
social	0
media	0
posts	1
or	0
even	0
just	0
read	0
the	0
tone	0
of	0
the	0
content	0
on	0
their	0
website. 	0
This	0
might	0
give	0
you	0
a	0
glimpse	0
of	0
their	0
therapy	0
style. 	0
Finally	1
you	0
can	0
call	0
or	0
email	0
potential	0
therapists	0
and	0
provide	0
a	0
brief	0
overview	0
of	0
your	0
presenting	0
problem	0
and	0
describe	0
what	0
you're	0
looking	0
for	0
in	0
your	0
ideal	0
therapist. 	0
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
specific	0
idea	0
of	0
what	0
you're	0
looking	0
for..	2
most	0
therapists	0
will	0
be	0
honest	0
if	0
they	0
don't	0
feel	0
they're	0
going	0
to	0
meet	0
your	0
expectations. 	0
Some	0
therapists	0
offer	0
free	0
short	0
phone	0
consultations	0
which	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
both	0
decide	0
if	0
you	0
would	0
work	0
well	0
together. 	0
Do	0
your	0
homework	0
upfront	1
and	0
you'll	0
be	0
well	0
on	0
your	0
way	0
to	0
finding	0
a	0
great	0
therapist	0
for	0
you!	0
I	0
am	0
so	0
sorry	0
you	0

 I	0
do	0
think	0
it's	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
share	0
your	0
feelings	0
with	0
your	0
parents	0
and	0
perhaps	0
get	0
some	0
help	0
connecting	0
with	0
a	0
counselor	0
or	0
therapist	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
might	0
help	2
 There	0
are	0
lots	0
of	0
ways	0
to	0
tell	0
them	1
depending	0
on	0
your	0
relationship	2
 Maybe	0
saying	0
"I	0
wanted	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0

something.	2
sometimes	0
I	0
worry	0
that	0
I	0
might	0
be	0
depressed."	0
Or	1
some	0
folks	0
will	0
write	0
a	0
letter	1
or	0
even	0
send	0
a	0
text	2
 The	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
tell	0
someone	0
you	0
trust	0
so	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
so	0
miserable	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps	2
 Best	0
of	0
luck	2
 	0
I	0
can	0
only	0
imagine	0
how	0
hard	0
that	0
must	0
have	0
been	0
to	0
hear	2
On	0
one	0
hand	1
most	0
of	0
us	0
would	0
say	0
we	0
want	0
our	0
partners	0
to	0
always	0
be	0
honest	0
with	0
us	1
but	0
on	0
the	0
other	0
disclosures	0
like	0
this	0
can	0
lead	0
to	0
feelings	0
of	0
worry	0
and	0
inadequacy	0
if	0
we're	0
not	0
careful	2
So	0
let	0
me	0
first	0
of	0
all	0
say	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
very	0
normal	0
for	0
human	0
beings	1
even	0
very	0
committed	0
and	0
happy	0
partners	0
to	0
have	0
moments	0
where	0
they	0
notice	0
an	0
attraction	0
for	0
someone	0
else	2
Quite	0
honestly	1
the	0
brain	0
can't	0
help	0
it	2
It	0
sees	0
something	0
good	0
looking	0
and	0
it	0
pays	0
attention	2
And	0
when	0
we	0
pay	0
attention	0
to	0
something	0
good	1
our	0
brains	0
send	0
out	0
neurochemicals	0
associated	0
with	0
that	0
happy	0
thought...and	0
we	0
get	0
a	0
rush	0
of	0
what	0
your	0
girlfriend	0
is	0
labeling	0
"a	0
crush."	0
The	0
difficulty	0
here	0
is	0
deciphering	0
whether	0
she	0
was	0
just	0
attempting	0
to	0
honor	0
her	0
commitment	0
to	0
you	0
by	0
sharing	0
this	0
feeling	0
OR	0
if	0
she	0
is	0
continuing	0
to	0
feed	0
those	0
feelings	2
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
thank	0
her	0
for	0
being	0
honest	0
if	0
you	0
haven't	0
already	1
and	0
ask	0
her	0
to	0
further	0
describe	0
the	0
nature	0
of	0
these	0
feelings	0
and	0
what	0
she'd	0
like	0
to	0

As	0
weird	0
as	0
it	0
is	0
to	0
say	1
at	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
the	0
day	1
what	0
helps	0
the	0
most	0
is	0
typically	0
reassuring	0
yourself	0
that	0
you	0
WILL	0
be	0

Hi	0
Los	0

your	0

he's	0
willing	0
to	0
cut	0
back	0
on	0
the	0
drinking	1
but	0
he	0
drinks	0
and	0
hides	0
it	2
His	0
behaviour	0
is	0
passive	0
aggressive	0
and	0
immature	1
which	0
puts	0
you	0
into	0
this	0
position	0
of	0
having	0
to	0
act	0
like	0
a	0
disapproving	0
parent	2
It	0
sounds	0
more	0
like	0
you're	0
talking	0
about	0
an	0
out-of-control	0
teenager	0
than	0
your	0
partner. Your	0
husband's	0
lying	0
is	0
sending	0
a	0
message	2
"I	0
get	0
to	0
make	0
my	0
own	0
decisions	0
and	0
you	0
can't	0
stop	0
me"	0
might	0
be	0
it	2
Underneath	0
that	1
maybe	0
it's	0
"I	0
want	0
to	0
stop	0
but	0
I'm	0
ashamed	0
that	0
I	0

Ultimately	1
as	0
an	0
adult	1
he	0
gets	0
to	0

what	0
he	0
puts	0
in	0
his	0
mouth	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
try	0
to	0
manage	0
that	0
by	0
monitoring	0
how	0

he	0
has	1
you	0

some	0
fallout..	2
pushback...backlash..	2
 How	0
does	0
his	0
drinking	0
affect	0
you	3
That's	0
where	0
your	0

has	0
power	1
rather	0
than	0
in	0
counting	0
his	0
beers	0
or	0
setting	0
him	0
up	0
to	0
lie	0
(when	0
he's	0
passed	0
out	1
asking	0
if	0
he's	0
been	0
drinking	0
seems	0
confusing)	2
You've	0
mentioned	0
snoring	1
which	0
I	0
guess	0
is	0
a	0
legitimate	0
complaint	2
If	0
he's	0
passing	0

that's	0
a	0
legitimate	0
complaint	2
When	0
he	0
drinks	0

he	0
drive	1
act	0
aggressively	1

'check	0
out	0

the	0

(avoid	0
you)	3
All	0
of	0
these	0

are	0

concerns	1

I'd	0
stick	0
to	0
talking	0
about	0
those	0
rather	0
than	0
counting	0
beers	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
he	0
has	0
few	0
other	0
ways	0
to	0
cope	0
with	0
stress	1
so	0
he	0
checks	0
out	0
with	0
alcohol	1
and	0
it	0
also	0
helps	0
him	0
avoid	0
your	0
relationship	2
But	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
it	0
makes	0
it	0
worse;	0
the	0
more	0
he	0
avoids	0
you	1
then	0
more	0
you	0
chase	0
him	0

What	0
we	0

that	0
the	0

the	0

It	0
depends	0
on	0
that	0
a	0

a	0

Hi	0
there, Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
openness	0
about	0
the	0
challenge	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	0
in	0
your	0
relationship	2
Sexual	0
intimacy	0
is	0
an	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
many	0
people's	0
life	1
but	0
how	0
much	0
importance	0
is	0
placed	0
on	0
it	0
varies	0
from	0
couple	0
to	0
couple. The	0
first	0
step	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
have	0
an	0
open	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0
husband	2
It's	0
important	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
open	0
about	0
what	0
you	0
desire	0
from	0
sexual	0
intimacy	0
and	0
how	0
much	0
intimacy	0
each	0
one	0
of	0
you	0
wants	2
For	0
example	1
asking	0
your	0
husband	0
how	0
often	0
does	0
he	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
sex/	0
week	0
or	0
/month	2
When	0
having	0
this	0
conversation	1
it's	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
respectful	0
and	0
open	0
with	0
each	0
other	2
The	0
point	0
of	0
the	0
conversation	0
is	0
to	0
get	0
to	0
know	0
each	0
other	0
and	0
not	0
to	0
solve	0
a	0
problem	1
yet. There	0
are	0
couples	0
who	0
enjoy	0
fulfilling	0
platonic/friendship	0
relationships	0
with	0
minimal	0
or	0
no	0
sex	0
because	0
both	0
partners	0
are	0
not	0
interested	0
in	0
it	2
If	0
you	0
are	0
both	0
on	0
the	0
same	0
page	0
-	0
lack	0
of	0
sex	0
might	0
not	0
be	0
a	0
problem. If	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
difference	0
in	0
your	0
sex	0
drive	0
and	0
frequency	0
of	0
desire	1
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
seeing	0
a	0
professional	0
relationship	0
&	0
sex	0
therapist	0
as	0
a	0
couple	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
explore	0
your	0
current	0
sexual	0
dynamic	1
what's	0
creating	0
it	1
what's	0
getting	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
of	0
connecting	0
sexually	0
and	0
to assist	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
husband	0
in	0
finding	0
creative	0
solutions	2
Would	0
you	0
feel	0
more	0
secure	0
in	0
conversations	0
if	0
instead	0
of	0
talking	0
soon	0
after	0
meeting	0
someone	0
or	0
entering	0
a	0
social	0
situation	1
you	0
simply	0
listened	0
attentively	0
to	0
the	0
other	0
people?This	0
way	0
you'd	0
have	0
a	0
more	0
secure	0
idea	0
of	0
what	0
topics	0
the	0
group	0
likes	0
talking	0
about	0
and	0
whether	0
you	0
like	0
talking	0
about	0
these	0
topics	0
as	0
well.Maybe	0
you	0
simply	0
are	0
in	0
groups	0
or	0
situations	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
don't	0
care	0
for	0
the	0
people	0
or	0
focus.Start	0
by	0
trusting	0
your	0
own	0
evaluation	0
of	0
your	0
true	0
interest	0
in	0
being	0
among	0
the	0
groups	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
are.Maybe	0
you	0
simply	0
need	0
new	0
and	0
different	0
groups	2
You	0
can	0
"move	0
on	0
and	0
not	0
live	0
in	0
the	0
past"	0
in	0
the	0
context	0
of	0
your	0
ex-relationship	1
but	0
that	0
does	0
not	0
mean	0
moving	0
on	0
from	0
your	0
child	2
"Moving	0
on"	0
then	0
would	0
involve	0
accepting	0
the	0
end	0
of	0
the	0
relationship	0
and	0
developing	0
a	0

 This	0

give	0

Hello,This	0
question	0
describes	0
a	0
very	0
typical	0
setup	0
of	0
what	0
is	0
called	0
the	0
 Binge	1
Repent	1
Repeat	0
cycle	2
This	0
means	0
that	0
typically	0
after	0
you	0
binge	1
you	0
experience	0
emotions	0
as	0
you	0
described	0
"shame	0
and	0
disappointment"	0
and	0
then	0
because	0
of	0
these	0
emotions	0
you	0
"repent"	0
(i.e	2
vow	0
to	0
never	0
binge	0
again	1
promise	0
to	0
"do	0
better,"	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
gym	1
etc.)	0
and	0
then	0
ultimately	0
end	0
up	0
bingeing	0
again. There	0
are	0
many	0
coping	0
mechanisms	0
for	0
binge	0
eating	0
and	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
best	0
is	0
actually	0
attempting	0
to	0
NORMALIZE	0
eating	2
Meaning	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
attempt	0
to	0
eat	0
normally	1
eating	0
appropriately	0
portioned	0
meals	0
3	0
times	0
a	0
day	1
with	0
snacks	0
in	0
between	2
IF	0
you	0
binge	1
then	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0
when	0
you	0
attempt	0
to	0
compensate	0
for	0
your	0
bingeing	0
behaviors	1
and	0
you	0
end	0
up	0
feeling	0
restricted	0
from	0
over	0
exercising	0
or	0
undereating	1
then	0
this	0
actually	0
leads	0
to	0
a	0
binge	0
again	2
Thus	1
reverting	0
you	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
cycle	2
If	0
you	0
binge	1
it	0
will	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
get	0
back	0
on	0
a	0
normal	0
schedule	0
of	0
eating	0
instead	0
of	0
trying	0
to	0
compensate	0
for	0
the	0
binge	2
Although	0
it	0
may	0
feel	0
counterproductive	1
getting	0
back	0
on	0
a	0
normal	0
eating	0
schedule	0
will	0
prevent	0
you	0
from	0
entering	0
into	0
the	0
restrictive	0
cycle. It	0
can	0
also	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0
the	0
binge	0
has	0
already	0
occurred	1
it	0
is	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
and	0
the	0
goal	0
is	0
to	0
move	0
forward	0
without	0
focusing	0
on	0
the	0
past	2
Focus	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
differently	0
next	0
time	2
What	0
emotions	0
or	0
situations	0
led	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
binge	3
What	0
can	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
prevent	0
or	0
change	0
the	0
circumstances	0
that	0
led	0
to	0
the	0
binge	1
or	0
the	0
way	0
that	0
you	0
handled	0
the	0
situation? Lastly	1
if	0
you're	0
struggling	0
with	0
"normalizing"	0
eating	1
it	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
work	0
with	0
a	0
professional	0
that	0
can	0
provide	0
counseling	0
and	0
coaching	0
to	0

 According	0
to	0

research	0
within	0

there	0
is	0
a	0

explanation	0
for	0
this	2
 When	0
a	0

forms	0
of	0
self	0
harm	1
the	0
body	0
produces	0

 If	0
a	0
person	0
was	0
dealing	0
with	0
depression	0

high	0
anxiety	1
that	0
might	0

misinterpreted	0
by	0
the	0

oneself	0

(addiction)	0
that	0
would	0
utilize	0
this	0

behavior	2
 Another	0
way	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
thru	0
a	0
behavioral	0
lens	1
a	0

a	0

the	0

those	0

find	0
someone	0

you	0
alternatives	0
that	0
take	0
into	0
account	0
the	0

requirement	0
by	0
replacing	0
the	0

with	0
another	0

(such	0
as	0

this	0

It	0
is	0
generally	0
very	0
normal	0
to	0
cry	0
in	0
therapy	1
and	0
for	0
many	0
reasons	2
Therapy	0
should	0
be	0
a	0

up	0

how	0

you	0

with	0
your	0

about	0

to	0

your	0

Sometimes	0

How	0

more	0
of	0
something	0

This	0
can	0
be	0
really	0
anxiety-producing	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
not	0
felt	0
it	0
before	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
work	0
through	0
some	0
of	0
this	0
with	0
a	0
local	0
therapist	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
more	0
specific	0
ideas.Some	0
other	0
things	0
that	0
come	0
to	0
my	0
mind	0
are	0
maybe	0
talking	0
about	0
spending	0
about	0
10	0
minutes	0
or	0
so	0
discussing	0
how	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
seeing	0
if	0
your	0
partner	0
is	0
willing	0
to	0
listen	2
Then	0
you	0
could	0
ask	0
questions	0
about	0
how	0
she	0
would	0
react	0
if	0
you	0
were	0
doing	0
something	0
she	0
did	0
not	0
like	2
This	0
allows	0
you	0
to	0
react	0
to	0
information	0
she	0
is	0
actually	0
giving	0
you	0
rather	0
than	0
your	0
perceptions	0
that	0
sound	0
like	0
they	0
are	0
different	0
than	0
what	0
she	0
is	0
trying	0
to	0
tell	0
you	2
This	0
gives	0
you	0
the	0
power	0
to	0
receive	0
the	0
messages	0
that	0
she	0
is	0
sending	0
to	0
you.I	0
would	0
also	0
wonder	0
where	0
you	0
have	0
learned	0
that	0
there	0
wasn't	0
much	0
good	0
out	0
there	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
how	0
you	0
can	0
stay	0
present	0
in	0
the	0
moment	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
with	0
your	0
girlfriend	0
and	0
see	0
that	0
she	0
wants	0
to	0
be	0
there	0
with	0
you	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
could	0
look	0
at	0
what	0
makes	0
you	0
feel	0
emotionally	0
safe	0
and	0
trusting	0
with	0
her	0
and	0
focus	0
on	0
that	2
You	0
could	0
even	0
remind	0
yourself	0
"okay	1
I'm	0
here	0
with	0
[name	0
of	0
girlfriend]	0
and	0
this	0
is	0
okay	0
when	0
I'm	0
with	0
her."We	0
all	0
have	0
different	0
levels	0
of	0
defenses	0
in	0
situations	0
in	0
which	0
different	0
people	2
It's	0
common	0
for	0
people	0
to	0
see	0
these	0
things	0
as	0
black	0
and	0
white	0
(either	0
totally	0
open	0
or	0
very	0
self-protective	2
In	0
reality	1
it's	0
much	0
more	0
like	0
a	0
rainbow	0
and	0
the	0
different	0
shades	0
of	0

that	0
are	0

the	0

You	0
can	0
change	0
your	0
level	0
of	0
defensiveness	0
with	0
your	0

thing	0
that	0

to	0

 A	0

all	0

 I	0

why	0

 Either	0

you	0
already	0
made	0
the	0
first	0
step	0
in	0

you	0
are	0
having	0
a	0
difficult	0
time. 	0
Well	0
let's	0
start	0
with	0
the	0
awesome	0
realization	0
you've	0
already	0
had	1
you	0
want	0
to	0
notice	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
triggers	2
That's	0
huge	2
Really. I	0
find	0
that	0
when	0
people	0
lie	1
it's	0
most	0
often	0
as	0
a	0
defense	0
mechanism	2
Which	0
is	0
likely	0
a	0
flag	0
that	0
something	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
safe	2
What	0
exactly	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
safe	0
could	0
be	0
lots	0
of	0
different	0
things	0
but	0
the	0
key	0
to	0
notice	0
is	0
that	0
it's	0
that	0
feeling	0
of	0
insecurity	0
that	0
is	0
very	0
likely	0
triggering	0
you. It	0
could	0
really	0
help	0
to	0
explore	0
this	0
with	0
therapist	1
perhaps	0
even	0
someone	0
with	0
a	0
trauma	0
specialty	0
--	0
that's	0
not	0
to	0
say	0
this	0
is	0
related	0
to	0
a	0
trauma	0
but	0
more	0
so	0
to	0
suggest	0
that	0
therapists	0
specializing	0
in	0
trauma	0
are	0
very	0
skilled	0
at	0
helping	0
to	0
identify	0
and	0
assist	0

repatterning	0
your	0
triggers!	0
What	0
a	0
tough	0
situation	0
you	0
must	0
be	0
in	1
feeling	0
torn	0
between	0
your	0
parents	0
and	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
very	0
special	0
to	0
you	2
I	0
would	0
say	0
the	0
first	0
thing	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
is (if	0
you	0
haven't	0
already)	1
have	0
a	0
calm	0
reciprocal	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0
parents	1
telling	0
them	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
and	0
letting them	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
need	0
from	0
them	2
If	0
communication	0
attempts	0
are	0
unsucessful	0
then	0
you	0
will	0
need	0
to	0
make	0
a	0
decision	0
with	0
how	0
you	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
move	0
forward	2
You	1
unfortunately	1
will	0
not	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
change	0
your	0
parent's	0
feelings	0
or	0
opinions	0
but	0
you	0
can	0
agree	0
to	0
disagree	0
on	0
certain	0
matters	0
by	0
keeping	0
them	0
separate	0
from	0
the relationship	0
you	0
have	0
with	0
your	0
parents	2
It	0
always	0
helps	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
see	0
things	0
from	0
another	0
angle	2
You	0
might	0
want	0
to	1
for	0
example	1
try	0
and	0
understand	0
your	0
parent's	0
perspectives	0
and	0
let	0
them	0
know	0
you	0
understand	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
upset	2
Validating	0
other's	0
feelings	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
helpful	0
with	0
communicating	0
effectively	2
Are	0
you	0
living	0
with	0
your	0
parents	0
and	0
do	0
they	0
support	0
you	3
If	0
so	1
are	0
you	0
willing	0
to	0
give	0
that	0
up	0

is	0
nothing	0
wrong	0
with	0
being	0
happy	0
with	0
someone	0
or	0
loving	0
somebody	0
so	0
deeply	2
Your	0
feelings	0
and	0
actions	0
certainly	0
do	0
not	0
make	0
you	0
brainwashed	0

a	0
devil	0

everyone	0

question	0

The	0
first	0
step	0
to	0

this	0

 The	0

to	0

 Alcohol	0
detox	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
dangerous	0
so	0
it	0
is	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
do	0
this	0
under	0
the	0
supervision	0
of	0
a	0
medical	0

someone	0

it	0
will	0
cause	0
you	0

an	0
increase	0
in	0

cravings	0
so	0
complete	0
abstinence	0
from	0

alcohol	0
is	0
needed. I	0
really	0
recommend	0
an	0

30	0

 If	0
this	0

the	0
next	0

there	0

The	0
first	0
step	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
scary	0
or	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
is	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
just	0
thoughts	0
and	0
we	0
can	0
choose	0
to	0
follow	0
the	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	0
or	0
work	0
with	0
cutting	0
them	0
off	0
or	0
ignoring	0
them	2
I	0
also	0
realize	0
that	0
might	0
seem	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
do	1
but	0
here's	0
a	0
good	0
way	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
brain	0
and	0
how	0
thought	0
patterns	0
work	2
Thoughts	0
arise	0
in	0
the	0
mind	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
our	0
brain	0
is	0
a	0
thought	0
machine	2
Many	0
thoughts	0
drift	0
by	0
like	0
clouds	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	0
while	0
other	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
and	0
they	0
trigger	0
us	0
in	0
a	0
particulate	0
way	1
i.e.	1
scary	1
angry	1
happy	1
sad	1
and	0
when	0
those	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
we	0
can	0
chose	0
to	0
pay	0
more	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
which	0
can	0
lead	0
us	0
down	0
that	0
particulate	0
thought	0
stream	0
that	0
will	0
lead	0
to	0
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	2
So	1
how	0
do	0
we	0
work	0
or	0
stop	0
those	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	3
One	0
new	0
skill	0
to	0
implement	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
work	0
of	0
Rick	0
Hansen	1
he	0
wrote	0
the	0
book	0
Buddha's	0
Brain,"	0
he	0
teaches	0
that	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
give	0
more	0
energy	0
and	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
positive	0
thoughts	0
or	0
positive	0
memories	0
we	0
hold	0
in	0
our	0
mind	0
and	0
pay	0
less	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	2
Hansen	0
asks	0
us	0
to	0
imagine	0
the	0
brain	0
this	0
way	1
the	0
brain	0
is	0
like	0
Velcro	0
with	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
and	0
like	0
teflon	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
positive	0
thoughts	2
There	0
are	0
reasons	0
that	0
our	0
brain	0
works	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
I	0
don't	0
have	0
time	0
to	0
go	0
into	0
all	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
this	0
response	2
So	1
it's	0
just	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
positive	0
thinking	1
actually	0
pausing	0
throughout	0
the	0
day	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
positive	0
feelings	0
and	0
memories	1
 this	0
will	0
help	0
the	0
mind	0
reinforce	0
positive	0
thought	0
streams	0
and	0
help	0
reduce	0
negative	0
thought	0
streams	0
over	0
time	2
If	0
a	0
scary	0
thought	0
arises	0
try	0
to	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
a	0
happy	0
experience	0
for	0
at	0

a	0

of	0

Hello.It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
really	0
concerned	0
about	0
your	0
daughter	0
because	0
you	0
have	0
noticed	0
a	0
significant	0
change	0
in	0
her	0
behavior	0
 	0
It's	0
really	0
a	0
great	0
first	0
step	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
reaching	0
out	0
to	0
get	0
some	0
ideas	0
about	0
what	0
might	0
be	0
going	0
on	0
 You	0
are	0
clearly	0
an	0
observant	0
and	0
hands	0
on	0
 mom	0
who	0
wants	0
to	0
be	0
sure	0
that	0
her	0
daughter	0
is	0
ok.This	0
is	0
a	0
tough	0
question	0
to	0
answer	0
without	0
more	0
information	0
 With	0
that	0
said	0
I	0
have	0
found	0
that	0
"under	0
stress	0
people	0
regress."	0
 In	0
other	0
words	0
many	0
people	0
children	0
and	0
adults	0
alike	0
often	0
regress	0
and	0
behave	0
differently	0
-	0
as	0
if	0
they	0
were	0
younger	0
than	0
their	0
actual	0
age	0
-	0
when	0
under	0
stress	0
 	0
Therefore	0
my	0
first	0
question	0
would	0
be	0
:	0
has	0
anything	0
been	0
happening	0
recently	0
that	0
is	0
causing	0
your	0
daughter	0
stress	0
 This	0
could	0
be	0
anything	0
from	0
conflict	0
at	0
home	0
recent	0
changes	0
such	0
as	0
moving	0
divorce	0
a	0
loss	0
of	0
some	0
kind	0
switching	0
schools	0
or	0
losing	0
a	0
friend	0
or	0
friends	0
 	0
Additionally	0
sometimes	0
if	0
children	0
are	0
feeling	0
bullied	0
or	0
left	0
out	0
by	0
same	0
age	0
peers	0
they	0
may	0
gravitate	0
toward	0
younger	0
playmates	0
as	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
boost	0
their	0
social	0
confidence	0
 	0
 I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
what	0
stressors	0
/	0
changes	0
may	0
have	0
occurred	0
recently	2
 You	0
may	0
also	0
want	0
to	0
check	0
in	0
with	0
her	0
teacher	0
(s)	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
they	0
have	0
noticed	0
any	0
changes	0
in	0
your	0
daughter's	0
behavior	0
at	0
school	0
.I	0
also	0
think	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0
daughter	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
a	0
sense	0
about	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
something	0
has	0
been	0
bothering	0
her	2
 Something	0
as	0
simple	0
as	0
"	0
I	0
have	0
noticed	0
that	0

 Am	0
I	0
right	0
about	0
that	0
"	0
and	0
then	0
if	0

you	0
might	0

how	0
you	0
saw	0
his	0

if	0
you're	0
in	0

Hello	1

let	0
me	0
say	0
first	1
what	0
a	0
great	0
question! There	0
are	0
so	0
many	0
people	0
putting	0
forth	0
their	0
100%	0
everyday	0
and	0
often	0
times	1
do	0
not	0
get	0
the	0
credit	0
they	0
deserve	2
Without	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
fully	0
understand	0
where	0
you're	0
question	0
is	0
coming	0
from	1
I	0
think	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
different	0
ways	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
this	0
question.First	1
I	0
think	0
it's	0
important	0
for	0
us	0
to	0
consider	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
by	0
those	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
stating	0
that	0
you're	0
"not	0
good	0
enough."	0
Is	0
that	0
ACTUALLY	0
what	0
they	0
said	1
or	0
is	0
this	0
just	0
what	0
you	0
heard	3
Sometimes	1
because	0
of	0
our	0
own	0
self-doubts	0
and	0
fears	1
we	0
skew	0
and	0
misinterpret	0
the	0
messages	0
we	0
receive	0
from	0
others	2
Again	1
listen	0
to	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
and	0
attempt	0
to	0
remain	0
objective	2
Is	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
coming	0
from	0
a	0
place	0
of	0
love	0
or	0
concern	3
If	0
so	1
have	0
an	0
honest	0
and	0
open	0
communication	0
with	0
that	0
individual	0
about	0
what	0
your	0
concerns	0
are	0
regarding	0
the	0
amount	0
of	0
energy	0
and	0
time	0
you're	0
spending	0
on	0
being	0
"good	0

with	0
them	0
how	0
you	0

your	0
best.If	0
the	0
person	0
is	0
unwilling	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
understanding	0
this	0
concern	0
you	0
have	1
then	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
time	0
to	0
explore	0
the	0
relationship	2
Some	0
relationships	0
we	0
engage	0
in	0
can	0
be	0
toxic	1
especially	0
if	0
the	0

It	0
may	0
be	0
they	0
have	0
their	0

the	0
need	0
to	0
constantly	0
put	0

themselves	0

better	2
If	0
you're	0
in	0

it	0

Explore	0
whether	0

you	0

continue	0
in	0
your	0

If	0
it's	0
a	0

what	0
you	0

it	0
may	0

exit	0
strategy	1
such	0
as	0
leaving	0

simply	0
refusing	0

YOU	0

this	0
expectation	0
you	0
have	0
for	0

you	0

also	0
let	0

the	0

Finding	0
out	0
the	0
cause	0
of	0
depression/anxiety	0
isn't	0
always	0
as	0
straightforward	0
as	0
it	0
seems	1
since	0
both	0

patterns	0
we	0
engage	0
in	0
rather	0
than	0
solely	0
related	0
to	0
a	0
specific	0
trigger/reason	2
For	0
example	1
if	0
I	0
am	0
feeling	0
down	0
about	0
a	0
particular	0
circumstance	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
then	0
I	0
start	0
seeing	0
life	0
through	0
this	0
lens	0
of	0
feeling	0
down	1
and	0
typically	0
I'll	0
start	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
that	0
I	0
get	0
down	0
about	1
and	0
it	0
can	0
really	0
build	0
very	0
quickly	0
on	0
itself	2
Same	0
with	0
anxiety	2
Obviously	1
this	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
simplified	0
example	0
and	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
difficult	0
to	0
see	0
how	0
the	0
pattern	0
is	0
maintained	1
but	0
that's	0
where	0
working	0
with	0
a	0
counselor/therapist	0
comes	0
in. I	0
would	0
be	0
curious	0
about	0
whether	0
you	0
can	0
start	0
to	0
notice	0
the	0
initial	0
sensations	0
of	0
panic	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
(through	0
the	0
panic	0
attack)	0
continue	0
to	0
maintain	0
awareness	0
of	0
the	0
actual	0
physical	0
sensations	2
Even	0
better	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
talk	0
yourself	0
through	0
the	0
sensations	0
you're	0
feeling	0
-	0
such	0
as	0
saying	0
to	0
yourself	0
"Okay	1
I'm	0
breathing	0
really	0
rapidly	1
and	0
my	0
heart	0
is	0
racing	1
now	0
my	0
palms	0
are	0
sweaty	0
and	0
my	0
chest	0
is	0
feeling	0
really	0
tight..."	0
Reminding	0
yourself	0
that	0
it's	0
just	0
your	0
body's	0
reaction	0
to	0
stress	1
and	0
while	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
overreacting	0
right	0

you're	0
okay	0

eventually	0
it	0
will	0
go	0
away	2

highly	0
recommend	0
the	0

Anxiety	0
Management	0
app	0
for	0
the	0
anxiety	0
piece	1
and	0
I	0
wouldn't	0
be	0
surprised	0
if	0
addressing	0
the	0
anxiety	0

to	0
address	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
depression	0
too	2
Hi	0
Greenville	1
I	0
respect	0
that	0
you're	0
owning	0
your	0
own	0
overreactions	1
and	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
give	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
the	0
respect	0
he	0
deserves	2
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
some	0
people	0
cheat	1
and	0
some	0
don't	1
and	0
our	0
partners	0
deserve	0
the	0
benefit	0
of	0
the	0
doubt	0
unless	0
they	0
show	0
signs	0
they	0
can't	0
be	0
trusted.The	0
answer	0
here	0
is	0
in	0
two	0
different	0
areas	2
Basically	1
if	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
feel	0
differently	0
(more	0
trusting	1
in	0
your	0
case)	1
you	0
look	0
at	0
your	0
thoughts	1
and	0
your	0
behaviours.Your	0
thoughts	0
are	0
stuck..	2
like	0
tires	0
in	0
deep	0
ruts	0
in	0
the	0
road	2
These	0
thoughts	0
are	0
only	0
habits	1
they	0
don't	0
reflect	0
the	0
truth	2
Fear	0
is	0
probably	0
whispering	0
in	0
your	0
ear	0
things	0
like	0
"everyone	0
cheats"	1
or	0
"	0
you're	0
not	0
enough	0
for	0
him"	2
Once	0

you	1

yourself	0
what	0
the	0
evidence	0
is	0
that	0
supports	0
that	0
thought	0
(there	0
won't	0
be	0
much...perhaps	0
none)	1
and	0
what	0
is	0
the	0
evidence	0
that	0
doesn't	0
support	0
it	0
(I	0
know	0
lots	0
of	0

I	0
know	0

and	0
loyalty	1
there	0

You're	0

to	0
refute	0
the	0
thoughts	0
that	0
are	0
connected	0

That's	0
the	0
first	0
half	2
Practise	0
these	0

your	0

you	0
broke	0
up	0
with	0

You	0

not	0

it	0

push	0
to	0
see	0
him	0
as	0
he's	0
moving	0
on	0
with	0
a	0

It's	0
appropriate	0
now	0
for	0
you	0
to	0

that	0

what	0

you	0

different	0
with	0
her	3
This	0
a	0
common	1

fear	0

The bottom line	0

someone	0

you	1

you	0
can't	0
make	0
someone	0

What	0
does	0
that	0
make	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
do? 	0
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
work	0
on	0
emotional	0
awareness. Emotional	0
awareness	0
basically	0
means	0
knowing	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
why.Emotional	0
awareness	0
also	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
identify	0
the	0
link	0
between	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
your	0
actions	2
In	0
other	0
words	0
knowing	0
that	0
your	0
feelings	0
dictate	0
what	0
you	0
do.Often	0
feelings	0
of	0
hurt	0
or	0
insecurity	0
can	0
come	0
out	0
as	0
anger	0
if	0
we	0
cannot	0
properly	0
identify	0
and	0
express	0
the	0
feelings.Being	0
emotionally	0
aware	0
also	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
express	0
your	0
feelings	0
to	0
others	2
Being	0
unable	0
to	0
do	0
so	0
leads	0
to	0
feelings	0
of	0
frustration	0
and	0
being	0
misunderstood.Many	0
people	0
for	0
many	0
different	0
reasons	0
are	0
not	0
in	0
touch	0
with	0
their	0
emotions	2
For	0
example	1
men	0
traditionally	0
have	0
been	0
brought	0
up	0
taught	0
to	0
not	0
express	0
sadness	0
or	0
weakness	2
Therefore	1
many	0
men	0
learned	0
to	0
turn	0
feelings	0
of	0
sadness	1
insecurities	1
or	0
fears	0
into	0
anger	0
and	0
express	0
these	0
feelings	0
as	0
anger	2
Being	0
taught	0
not	0
to	0
feel	0
a	0
certain	0
emotion	0
does	0
not	0
make	0
that	0
emotion	0
disappear	2
Instead	0
it	0
makes	0
us	0
learn	0
how	0
to	0
express	0
it	0
in	0
other	1
incorrect	1
ways	2
If	0
a	0
man	0
never	0
learns	0
to	0
say	0
“I	0
am	0
sad”	0
or	0
“that	0
really	0
hurt	0
my	0
feelings”	0
and	0
instead	0
lashes	0
out	0
in	0
anger	1
then	0
the	0
response	0
they	0
get	0
from	0
those	0
around	0
them	0
will	0
be	0
to	0
the	0
anger	0
and	0
not	0
a	0
response	0
to	0
the	0
underlying	0
true	0
feeling	1
which	0
will	0
leave	0
the	0
man	0
feeling	0
alone	0
and	0
misunderstood.You	0
can	0
control	0
yourself	0
and	0
not	0
explode	2
Walk	0
away	1
remove	0
yourself	0
from	0
the	0
situation	1
do	0
whatever	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
to	0
not	0
lash	0
out	2
Instead	0
of	0
reacting	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
normally	0
would	1
go	0
somewhere	0
by	0
yourself	0
and	0
think	0
about	0
what	0
just	0
happened	0
and	0
try	0
to	0
understand	0
why	0

a	0
“simple”	0
thing	0

you	2
What	0
is	0
the	0
real	0
feeling	0
driving	0
these	0
outbursts	3
Maybe	0
you	0
can	0
begin	0
to	0
recognize	0
an	0
underlying	0
pattern. It	0
might	0
help	0
to	0
keep	0
an	0
anger	0
journal	2
Write	0
down	0
everything	0
that	0

what	0
may	0
be	0
setting	0
you	0
off	2
Talking	0

I	0

we	0
all	0

through	0
a	0
period	0
of	0
time	0
where	0
we	0
think	0
we	0
aren't	0

anything	2
Sometimes	0
these	0
feelings	0
are	0
a	0
result	0
of	0
low	0
self	0

because	0
of	0
shame	2
The	0
most	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
dealing	0
with	0
this	0

is	0
to	0
separate	0

a	0

try	0
to	0
reframe	0
what	0

Therapy	0
can	0
feel	0
very	0
weird	0
to	0
begin	0
with	0

think	0
about	0
it	1

So	0
I	0
think	0
its	0
reasonable	0
to	0
expect	0
a	0

level	0

That	0

Being	0
a	0
parent	0
can	0
be	0
all-consuming. 	0

there	0

about	0

We	0
can	0
certainly	0

that	0

This	0
may	0

sometimes. I	0
can	0
tell	0
that	0
you're	0

you	0
seem	0
to	0
sense	0
that	0
the	0
two	0
things	0
you	0
wrote	0
about	0
are	0
connected...you	0
"not	0

yourself"	1
and	0
then	0
how	0
you	0
felt	0
when	0
your	0
grandma	0
died. When	0
Grandma	0
died	1
you	0
needed	0
and	0
deserved	0
extra	0
love	0
and	0
support	1
but	0
the	0
people	0
around	0
you	0
didn't	0
seem	0
to	0
give	0
it	0
to	0
you	1
maybe	2
My	0
hunch	0
is	0
that	0
they	0
wanted	0
to	1
but	0
that	0
they	0
didn't	0
know	0
how	0
much	0
you	0
needed	0
it	1
or	0
what	0
you	0
needed	0
exactly	2
The	0
older	0
you	0
get	1
the	0
more	0
you	0
will	0
have	0
to	0
take	0
charge	0
of	0
letting	0
people	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
need	2
Maybe	0
this	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
suckier	0
parts	0
of	0
being	0
mature	1
but	0
that's	0
how	0
it	0
works. When	0
you	0
started	0
middle	0
school	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
changed;	0
you	0
got	0
more	0
quiet	1
right	3
That	0
must	0
have	0
felt	0
weird	1
to	0
not	0
be	0
acting	0
like	0
yourself	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
fear	0
tricked	0
you	0
into	0
thinking	0
people	0
wouldn't	0
like	0
you	2
Fear	0
can	0
be	0
silly	2
So	0
then	1
fear	0
got	0
you	0
to	0
not	0
show	0
yourself	1
and	0
when	0
we	0
don't	0
show	0
ourselves	1
people	0
can't	0
see	0
who	0
we	0
are;	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
us	0
as	0
well	0
and	0
then	0
they	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
we	0
need	0
and	0
they	0
can't	0
care	0
for	0
us	0
as	0
well	0
either	2

not	0

the	0

It	0
does	0
that	0
to	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
us. So	1
where	0
you're	0
at	0
right	0
now	0
is	0
because	0
of	0
what	0
fear	0
did	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
also	0
because	0
when	0
Grandma	0
died	0
you	0
were	0
already	0
isolated	0
so	0
people	0
couldn't	0
see	0
your	0
pain	0
and	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
needed	0
support. There's	0
a	0
simple	0
solution	1
but	0
you'd	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
brave	0
enough	0
to	0
look	0
fear	0
in	0
the	0
face	0
and	0
say	0
"Get	0
off	0
my	0

"You're	0

you	0

that	0

Well	0
let's	0
start	0
with	0
the	0

realization	0

you	0
want	0
to	0
notice	0
that	0
you	0

That's	0
huge	2
Really. I	0
find	0
that	0
when	0
people	0
lie	1
it's	0
most	0
often	0
as	0
a	0
defense	0
mechanism	2
Which	0
is	0

a	0
flag	0
that	0
something	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
safe	2
What	0
exactly	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
safe	0
could	0
be	0
lots	0
of	0
different	0
things	0
but	0
the	0
key	0
to	0
notice	0
is	0
that	0
it's	0
that	0
feeling	0
of	0
insecurity	0
that	0
is	0
very	0
likely	0
triggering	0
you. It	0
could	0
really	0
help	0
to	0

this	0
with	0
therapist	1

There	0

they're	0
point	0
of	0
view	0
of	0
your	0

Sometimes	0

it	0
over	0

you	0

out	0

you're	0

out	0

Talking	0
to	0
a	0
therapist	0
is	0
also	0
a	0
good	0
option	0
as	0
a	0
therapist	0
can	0
hello	0
you	0
figure	0
out	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
looking	0
for	0
and	0
address	0
any	0
issues	0
that	0

First	1
let	0
me	0
extend	0
my	0
compassion	0
to	0

it	0

you	0

Childhood	0
trauma	0
carries	0
its	0
negative	0
effects	0
into	0
our	0
adulthood	0
and	0
affects	0
everyone	0
who	0

question	0
is	0
brief	1
so	0
I'll	0
just	0
try	0
to	0
give	0
general	0
answers	0
as	0
best	0
I	0
can	2
From	0
my	0
experiences	0
treating	0
many	0
people	0
with	0
your	0
boyfriend's	0
experiences	1
the	0
short	1
healthy	0
answer	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can't	0
fix	0
the	0
situation	0
and	0
maybe	0
not	0
even	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	2
He	0
needs	0
a	0
professional	2
Period. What	0
you	0
can do	1
is	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	2
With	0
his	0
background	1
it	0
is	0
not	0
likely	0
that	0
he	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
or	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
you	0
in	0
a	0
healthy	0
way	2
Your	0
task	0
needs	0
to	0
prioritize	0
your	0
own	0
safety	0
and	0
well-being	2
Trauma	0
and	0
substance	0
abuse	0
are	0
the	0
definition	0
of	0
being	0
out	0
of	0
control	1
unable	0
to	0
set	0
and	0
manage	0
appropriate	0
boundaries	1
manage	0
his	0
own	0
emotions	0
and	0
behaviors	2
So	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
is	0
unlikely	0
to	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
change	0
in	0
the	0
near-term	1
certainly	0
not	0
without	0
professional	0
help	2
You	0
might	0
also	0
benefit	0
from	0

how	0
you	0
can	0
make	0

in	0
your	0

I	0
am	0
NOT	0
blaming	0
you	0
for	0
any	0
aspect	0
of	0
your	0

behavior	1
only	0
acknowledging	0
that	0
there	0

two	0
people	0

If	0

your	0

drinking	0
and	0
violent	0
outbursts	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
(by	0
staying	0
in	0
the	0
relationship)	1
that	0
is	0
likely	0
to	0
perpetuate	0
his	0
behavior	2
And	0
there	0
isn't	0
any	0
way	0
to	0
"handle	0
violent	0
outbursts."	0
They	0
shouldn't	0
be	0
handled	0
at	0
all	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
away	0
from	0
your	0

during	0
his	0
outbursts	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
be	0
emotionally	0
and	0
physically	0
safe	1
then	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
what	0
you	0
will	0
have	0
to	0
do. We	0
can	0
never	0
really	0
change	0
anyone	0
else	2
The	0
only	0
person	0
we	0
can	0
change	0
is	0
ourselves	2
Sometimes	0
our	0
behavior	0
changes	0
the	0
odds	0
of	0
another	0
person's	0
behaviors	1
but	0
it	0
doesn't	0
control	0
it	2
I	0
would	0

that	0
you	0
work	0
with	0
a	0
professional	0
to	0
first	1
ensure	0
your	0

above	0

Whatever	0
your	0

does	0
in	0

you	0
will	0

Let	0

This	0

someone	0
who	0

time	0

more	0
about	0

You	0
have	0
the	0

within	0
yourself, 	0

it	0
sometimes	0
takes	0
a	0
keen	0

lead	0
you	0
to	0
those	0
answers. 	0
This	0
can't	0
happen	0

You	0

you	0
change	0
in	0

in	0

always	0

Sometimes	0
it	0

that	0
their	0

are	0
D's	0

F's	2
For	0
other	0

it	0
means	0
that	0
the	0

in	0
that	0

that	0

 Best	0
of	0
luck	0
to	0
you!	0
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
work	0
on	0
emotional	0
awareness. Emotional	0
awareness	0
basically	0
means	0
knowing	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
why.Emotional	0
awareness	0
also	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
identify	0
the	0
link	0
between	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
your	0
actions	2
In	0
other	0
words	0
knowing	0
that	0
your	0
feelings	0
dictate	0
what	0
you	0
do.Often	0
feelings	0
of	0
hurt	0
or	0
insecurity	0
can	0
come	0
out	0
as	0
anger	0
if	0
we	0
cannot	0
properly	0
identify	0
and	0
express	0
the	0
feelings.Being	0
emotionally	0
aware	0
also	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
express	0
your	0
feelings	0
to	0
others	2
Being	0
unable	0
to	0
do	0
so	0
leads	0
to	0
feelings	0
of	0
frustration	0
and	0
being	0
misunderstood.Many	0
people	0
for	0
many	0
different	0
reasons	0
are	0
not	0
in	0
touch	0
with	0
their	0
emotions	2
For	0
example	1
men	0
traditionally	0
have	0
been	0
brought	0
up	0
taught	0
to	0
not	0
express	0
sadness	0
or	0
weakness	2
Therefore	1
many	0
men	0
learned	0
to	0
turn	0
feelings	0
of	0
sadness	1
insecurities	1
or	0
fears	0
into	0
anger	0
and	0
express	0
these	0
feelings	0
as	0
anger	2
Being	0
taught	0
not	0
to	0
feel	0
a	0
certain	0
emotion	0
does	0
not	0
make	0
that	0
emotion	0
disappear	2
Instead	0
it	0
makes	0
us	0
learn	0
how	0
to	0
express	0
it	0
in	0
other	1
incorrect	1
ways	2
If	0
a	0
man	0
never	0
learns	0
to	0
say	0
“I	0
am	0
sad”	0
or	0
“that	0
really	0
hurt	0
my	0
feelings”	0
and	0
instead	0
lashes	0
out	0
in	0
anger	1
then	0
the	0
response	0
they	0
get	0
from	0
those	0
around	0
them	0
will	0
be	0
to	0
the	0
anger	0
and	0
not	0
a	0
response	0
to	0
the	0
underlying	0
true	0
feeling	1
which	0
will	0
leave	0
the	0
man	0
feeling	0
alone	0
and	0
misunderstood.You	0
can	0
control	0
yourself	0
and	0
not	0
explode	2
Walk	0
away	1
remove	0
yourself	0
from	0
the	0
situation	1
do	0
whatever	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
to	0
not	0
lash	0
out	2
Instead	0
of	0
reacting	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
normally	0

go	0
somewhere	0

think	0
about	0
what	0

try	0
to	0

“simple”	0
thing	0
upset	0
you	2
What	0
is	0
the	0
real	0
feeling	0
driving	0
these	0
outbursts	3
Maybe	0
you	0
can	0
begin	0
to	0
recognize	0
an	0

pattern. It	0
might	0

to	0
keep	0
an	0

journal	2
Write	0
down	0
everything	0

what	0

a	0

the	0

She	0

I	0
bet	0
your	0

Can	0
you	0

 Okay	1

my	0

that	0
you	0
both	0
have	0
a	0

She	0

You	0
want	0

Then	0
you	0

that	0

you	0

that	0

she	0

the	0

To	0
oppose	0
her	0

your	0

feel	0
the	0

The	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
to	0

that	0
you	0

you.In	0
the	0
end	1
if	0

that	0

But	0
the	0
evidence	0
is	0
pretty	0
clear	1
isn't	0
it? A	0

be	0
built	0
on	0
a	0
foundation	0
of	0

I	0
believe	0
that	0
as	0

that	0

out	0

of	0
what	0

Unfortunately	1
there	0
isn’t	0
anything	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
that	0
will	0
change	0
his	0
behavior	2
He	0
has	0
to	0
make	0
that	0
decision	0
for	0
himself	2
It	0
is	0
difficult	0
for	0
abusers	0
to	0
do	0
this	0
because	0
they	0
have	0
to	0
admit	0
that	0
thier	0
behavior	0
is	0
fully	0
thier	0
responsibility	2
Abusers	1
a	0

then	0
turn	0
around	0

again	2
I	0
would	0
strongly	0
discourage	0
any	0
couples	0

in	0
an	0

this	0

in	0

Before	0

you	0
should	0
examine	0
these	0
areas	0

see	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
high	0
in	0
rating. 	0
Otherwise	1
yes	0
this	0

will	0
affect	0
your	0

I	0

pre-marital. 	0
Not	0

Hello	0
there. 	0
Thank	0
you	0
for	0
sharing	0
your	0
heart	0
here. 	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
start	0
off	0
by	0
saying	1
in	0
kind	0
of	0
an	0
ironic	0
way	1
your	0
struggle	0
is	0
something	0
many	0
people	0
go	0
through	1
I	0
might	0
say	0
quite	0
often. 	0
Many	0
feel	0
alone	0
with	0
one	0
another	0
quite	0
frequently. 	0
THe	0
reasons	0
for	0
feeling	0
alone	0
vary	0
much	0
between	0
person	0
to	0
person. 	0
In	0
reading	0
how	0
you	0
presented	0
things	1
I	0
will	0
just	0
respond	0
from	0
how	0
this	0
strikes	0
me. 	0
Sometimes	0
feeling	0
alone	0
might	0
be	0
the	0
result	0
of	0
not	0
completing	0
the	0
second	0
half	0
of	0
the	0
equation;	0
meaning	0
that	0
although	0
people	0
"listen"	0
it	0
wont	0
necessarily	0
equate	0
the	0
elimination	0
of	0
being	0
alone	2
Instead	1
its	0
when you	0
follow	0
up	0
by	0
inquiring	0
and	0
listening	0
to	0
others	0
that you	0
 may	0
discover	0
they	0
feel	0
and	0
think	0
and	0
struggle	0
just	0
like	0
you	0
do. And	0
as	0
a	0
result	1
you	0
discover	0
you	0
really	0
were	0
never	0
alone;	0
when	0
people	0
discover	0
common	0
struggle	0
and	0
feelings	1
we	0
are	0
connected. 	0
Second	1
we	0
as	0
humans	0
are	0
sometimes	0
feeling	0
alone	0
because	0
we	0
may	0
be	0
lacking	0
some	0
self-acceptance. 	0
Not	0
fully	0
accepting	0
myself	0

It	0

this	0
out	2
First	1
has	0
your	0

you	0
any	0

not	0
to	0

them	3
Have	0
they	0

they	0

of	0
the	0
doubt	0
until	0
there	0

evidence	2
If	0
it's	0
a	0

then	0
it's	0
natural	0
that	0
these	0

you	0

scenarios	0

to	0

a	0
moment	0
and	0
write	0
down	0
what	0
the	0
evidence	0
is	0
that	0
cheating	0
is	0
going	0
on	2
What	0
is	0
the	0
specific	0
thing	0
that's	0
triggering	0
your	0
fears	3
When	0
you	0
have	0
your	0

that	0
you	0

been	0
personally	0
hurt	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
by	0
someone	0
else	0
and	0
you've	0
developed	0
fears	0
that	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
hurt	0
again	0
or	0
that	0
you're	0
not	0
enough	0
to	0
keep	0
someone	0
interested	0
(this	0
is	0
just	0
fear...people	0
cheat	0
for	0
their	0
own	0
reasons	1
not	0
because	0
we're	0
not	0
interesting)	2
This	0
may	0
be	0
true	0
if	0
what	0
you	0

down	0

"They	0

is	0
no	0
evidence	2
I'm	0
just	0

That's	0
a	0

some	0

yourself	0

your	0

Ask	0
your	0

up	0

third	0
possibility	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
some	0

cheating	2
Maybe	0
there	0

texts	0
on	0
a	0

someone	0

told	0
you	0
something	0

it's	0
okay	0
to	0
present	0
this	0
to	0
your	0

If	0
this	0

there	0
are	0
only	0

then	0
it's	0

is	0

this	0

the	0
second	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
find	0
a	0
counselor	0
who	0

in	0
treating	0
clients	0
with	0
Anxiety	0
and	0
Depression	2

the	0
most	0

outcome	0
for	0

 The	0
third	0

is	0
to	0
increase	0
your	0
positive	0
self-talk	0
to	0

treatment	2
As	0

Hi	0

There's	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
keep	0
your	0
past	0
from	0
affecting	0
your	0
present	0
and	0
future	1
because	0
it's	0
a	0
huge	0
part	0
of	0
who	0
we	0
are	2
The	0
GOOD	0
news	0
is	1
though	1
that	0
the	0
effect	0
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
negative	2
I'm	0
met	0
many	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
horrific	0
pasts	0
and	0
it	0
helps	0
them	0
know	0
confidently	1
every	0
day	1
what	0
kind	0
of	0
person	0
they	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
and	0
what	0
kind	0
of	0
world	0
they	0
want	0
to	0
live	0
in	1
and	0
it	0
helps	0
them	0
make	0
really	0
great	0
decisions	2
You	0
can	0
accept	0
your	0
past	1
integrate	0
your	0
traumas	0
and	0
move	0
forward	0
in	0
a	0
very	0
different	0
way. If	0
you	0
see	0
negative	0
ways	0
in	0
which	0
your	0
past	0
affects	0
you	0
(and	0
this	0
is	0
also	0
common)	1
you	0
are	0
wise	0
to	0
seek	0
professional	0
help	2
Without	0
knowing	0
more	1
it's	0
impossible	0
to	0
give	0
you	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
direction	0
here	2
Basically	1
our	0
past	0
creates	0
emotional	0
"bruises"	0
that	0
are	0
touch	0
on	0
and	0
triggered	0
by	0
present	0
situations	2
But	0
our	0
reactions	0
are	0
often	0
about	0
more	0
than	0
just	0
the	0
present	0
moment	2
I	0
think	0

A	0
counselor	0
can	0
do	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
helpful:1)	0
Give	0
you	0
a	0
space	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
explore	0
what's	0
in	0
your	0
head	0
without	0
worrying	0
about	0

judged	0
or	0
punished.2)	0
Help	0
you	0
better	0
understand	0
yourself	1
your	0
choices	1
your	0

Give	0
you	0
tools	0
and	0
information	0
you	0
can	0
use	0
to	0
help	0
create	0
change	0
in	0
your	0
life. Ultimately	1
though	1
it's	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
client	0
to	0
take	0
action	1

action	0

what	0

So	1
a	0

can't	0
create	0

..	2

they	0
can	0
facilitate	0

that	0

why	0

that	0
it	0

not	0
that	0

Accepting	0
the	0

Take	0
a	0

of	0
the	0

shared	0
with	0
your	0
mom	0
before	0
her	0
getting	0
Alzheimer's. 	0
Remember	0
that	0
your	0
mom	0
as	0
she	0
was	0
is	0
no	0
longer	0
and	0
that	0
she	0
has	0
reverted	0
to	0
a	0
more	0
delicate	0
phase. 	0
Also	1
schedule	0
time	0
for	0
yourself	0
and	0
do	0
things	0
that	0
help	0
you	0

Caretaking	0

an	0

Finally	1

Anger	0
is	0
a	0
normal	0
emotion	1
no	0
different	0
than	0
joy	1
elation	1
or	0
sadness	2
It's	0
not	0
anger	0
that	0
gets	0
us	0
in	0
trouble	0
it's	0
the	0
overtness	0
of	0
the	0

Being	0
able	0
to	0
control	0
your	0
temper	0
depends	0
on	0
several	0
variables:	0
how	0
you	0
saw	0
anger	0
acted	0
out	0
as	0
a	0
child	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
your	0
primary	0
caregivers	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
internalized	0
as	0
being	0
normal	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
managing	0
conflict	1
and	0
your	0
communication	0
style	0
regarding	0
how	0
you	0
confront	0
problematic	0
situations	2
There	0
are	0
some	0
whose	0
anger	0
takes	0
on	0
a	0
volcano	0
effect	0
whereby	0
they	0
don't	0
readily	0
address	0
problematic	0
situations	0
but	0
rather	0
they	0
continue	0
to	0
stuff	0
their	0
emotion	0
until	0
the	0
right	0
trigger	0
causes	0
them	0
them	0
to	0
explode	1
and	0
then	0
there	0
are	0
those	0
who	0
are	0
very	0
impulsive	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
how	0
they	0
react	0
to	0
stressful	0
situations	1
they	0
don't	0
take	0
time	0
to	0
think	0
out	0
situations	0
or	0
to	0
make	0
sense	0
of	0
them	1
they	0
just	0
impulsively	0
respond	2
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
seek	0
anger	0
management	0
from	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
utilizes	0
a	0
Cognitive	0
Behavioral	0
approach	0
in	0
order	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
explore	0
how	0
your	0
irrational	0
thinking	0
related	0

certain	0
situations	0
may	0
be	0
influencing	0
your	0

behavior	2
In	0

I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
activities	0
that	0
promote	0
stress	0
reduction	0
if	0
your	0

are	0
indeed	0

The	0
first	0
step	0
is	0
recognizing	0

you	0

a	0

that	0
you	0

help	0
in	0
understanding	0
and	0
addressing	1

you	0
have	1
now	0
take	0
the	0
next	0
step	0
in	0
finding	0
a	0
therapist	0
in	0
order	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
learn	0
to	0
control	0
your	0
temper	0
and	0
undo	0
some	0
faulty	0
wiring	0
that	0
may	0
be	0
related	0
to	0
how	0
you	0
process	0
emotion	1
and	0
communicate	0
that	0
you're	0
angry	2
Remember	1
anger	0
is	0
the	0
overt	0
expression	0
of	0
some	0
other	0
emotion	0

disappointment	1
hurt	1
frustration	1

The	0
termination	0

a	0
challenge	0
to	0

from	2
Having	0
obsessions	0
after	0
a	0
breakup	0
are	0
very	0
normal	0
and	0
many	0
of	0
my	0
clients	0
experience	0
them	2
It	0
can	0
help	0
to	0
create	0
a	0
distraction	0
box	0
and	0
when	0
the	0
obsessions	0
present	0
themselves	0
use	0
your	0
distraction	0
activities	2
In	0
the	0
beginning	0
try	0
to	0
distract	0
from	0
the	0
obsessions	0
for	0
5	0
minutes	0
and	0
work	0

increase	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
I	0
am	0
very	0
sorry	0
that	0
this	0
was	0
your	0
experience	0
with	0
your	0
family	2
I	0
truly	0
wish	0
I could	0
give	0
you	0
some	0
things	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
them	0
that	0
would	0
change	0
their	0
reaction	1
but	0
unfortunately	0
I	0
can't	0
do	0
that	2
Their	0
acceptance	0
of	0
you is	0
a	0
journey	1
just	0
like	0
coming	0
out	0
is	0
a	0
journey	0
for	0
you	2
Sometimes	0
families	0
initially	0
respond	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
after	0
time	0
they	0
become	0
more	0
accepting	0
and	0
even	0
supportive	2
Unfortunately	1
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
know	0
for	0
sure	0
if	0
that	0
will	0
happen	2
So	1
here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
I	0
would	0
suggest:Surround	0
yourself	0
with	0
people	0
and	0
things	0
that	0
remind	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
really	0
are	0
okay	0
as	0
you	0
are	2
That	0
won't	0
take	0
the	0
place	0
of	0
your	0
family's	0
acceptance	1
and	0
I	0
won't	0
even	0
pretend	0
that	0
it	0
would	1
but	0
it	0
may	0
help	0
during	0
those	0
days	0
when	0
it	0
hurts	0
the	0
most	2
And	0
that	0
is	0
really	0
important	2
Patience	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
that	0
many	0
of	0
us	0
are	0
really	0
good	0
at	1
but	0
this	0
type	0
of	0
situation	0
sometimes	0
forces	0
you	0
to	0
have	0
some	2
When	0
families	0
first	0
learn	0
something	0
like	0
this	1
they	0
may	0
go	0
through	0
a	0
period	0
of	0
shock	2
And	0
then	0
sometimes	0
even	0
grieving	2
They	0
may	0
even	0
be	0
worried	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
of	0
a	0
particular	0
religion	0
where	0
being	0
bisexual	0
is	0
forbidden	2
These	0
things	0
can	0
take	0
time	0
for	0
them	0
to	0
reconcile	1
so	0
it	0
may	0
just	0
take	0
some	0
patience	2
If	0
it	0
is	0
safe	0
for	0
you	1
try	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
them	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
becomes	0
painful	0
or	0
hurtful	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
right	0
to	0
walk	0
away	2
I	0
do	0
recommend	0
setting	0
up some	0
personal	0
boundaries	0
for	0
yourself	1
and	0
perhaps	0
learn	0
some	0
assertiveness	0
skills	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
struggle	0
with	0
them	2
The	0
reason	0
I	0
feel	0
that	0
this	0
is	0
important	0
is	0
that	0
people	0
sometimes	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
abuse	0
from	0
family	0
members	0
and	0
friends	0
in	0
times	0
like	0
you're	0
describing	2
They	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
accepted	0
so	0
much	0
that	0
they	0
put	0
themselves	0
in	0
hurtful	0
positions	0
over	0
and	0
over	0
again	0
hoping	0
that	0
their	0
families	0
will	0
come	0
around	2
They	0
may	1
or	0
they	0
may	0
not	2
And	0
if	0
they	0
don't	1
you	0
deserve	0
to	0
live	0
a	0
life	0
free	0
of	0
abuse	0
and	0
to	0
feel	0
confident	0
and	0
assured	0
of	0
who	0
you	0
are	2
To	0
be	0
surrounded	0
by	0
folks	0

remind	0
you	0

that. If	0
you	0
start seeing	0
this	0
pattern	0

you	0
are	0
struggling	1
chatting	0
with counselor	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
great	0
idea	2

Hello,This	0
question	0
describes	0
a	0
very	0
typical	0
setup	0
of	0
what	0
is	0
called	0
the	0
 Binge	1
Repent	1
Repeat	0
cycle	2
This	0
means	0
that	0
typically	0
after	0
you	0
binge	1
you	0
experience	0
emotions	0
as	0
you	0
described	0
"shame	0
and	0
disappointment"	0
and	0
then	0
because	0
of	0
these	0
emotions	0
you	0
"repent"	0
(i.e	2
vow	0
to	0
never	0
binge	0
again	1
promise	0
to	0
"do	0
better,"	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
gym	1
etc.)	0
and	0
then	0
ultimately	0
end	0
up	0
bingeing	0
again. There	0
are	0
many	0
coping	0
mechanisms	0
for	0
binge	0
eating	0
and	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
best	0
is	0
actually	0
attempting	0
to	0
NORMALIZE	0
eating	2
Meaning	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
attempt	0
to	0
eat	0
normally	1
eating	0
appropriately	0
portioned	0
meals	0
3	0
times	0
a	0
day	1
with	0
snacks	0
in	0
between	2
IF	0
you	0
binge	1
then	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0
when	0
you	0
attempt	0
to	0
compensate	0
for	0
your	0
bingeing	0
behaviors	1
and	0
you	0
end	0
up	0
feeling	0
restricted	0
from	0
over	0
exercising	0
or	0
undereating	1
then	0
this	0
actually	0
leads	0
to	0
a	0
binge	0
again	2
Thus	1
reverting	0
you	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
cycle	2
If	0
you	0
binge	1
it	0
will	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
try	0
and	0
get	0
back	0
on	0
a	0
normal	0
schedule	0
of	0
eating	0
instead	0
of	0
trying	0
to	0
compensate	0
for	0
the	0
binge	2
Although	0
it	0
may	0
feel	0
counterproductive	1
getting	0
back	0
on	0
a	0
normal	0
eating	0
schedule	0
will	0
prevent	0
you	0
from	0
entering	0
into	0
the	0
restrictive	0
cycle. It	0
can	0
also	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0
the	0
binge	0
has	0
already	0
occurred	1
it	0
is	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
and	0
the	0
goal	0
is	0
to	0
move	0
forward	0
without	0
focusing	0
on	0
the	0
past	2
Focus	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
differently	0
next	0
time	2
What	0
emotions	0
or	0
situations	0
led	0
up	0
to	0
the	0
binge	3
What	0
can	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
prevent	0
or	0
change	0
the	0
circumstances	0
that	0
led	0
to	0
the	0
binge	1
or	0
the	0
way	0
that	0
you	0
handled	0
the	0
situation? Lastly	1
if	0
you're	0
struggling	0
with	0
"normalizing"	0
eating	1
it	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
work	0
with	0
a	0
professional	0
that	0
can	0
provide	0
counseling	0
and	0
coaching	0
to	0

isn't	0
it	3
Sometimes	0
it's	0
tough	0
even	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
100%	0
sure	0
that	0

One	0
of	0

it's	0

It's	0
more	0
of	0
a	0

This	0

there	0

feelings	0

come	0
up	0
even	0
after	0
the	0

For	0
example	1
someone	0
can	0
end	0
an	0

today	1

then	0
be	0
reminded	0
of	0
the	0
good	0
times	0
on	0
what	0
would have	0
been	0
their	0
"anniversary."	0
This	0
could	0
make	0
the	0
person	0
very	0
sad	2
They	0
may	0
even	0
regret	0
ending	0
the	0
relationship	0
for	0
a	0
little	0
while	2
It	0
would	0
important	1
then	1
for	0
the	0

themselves	0
why	0
the	0
relationship	0
needed	0
to	0

that	0
they	0
are	0
healthier	0

This	0
is	0

It's	0
hard	0
to	0
walk	0
away	0
from	0
a	0
relationship	2
We	0
fear	0
all	0
kinds	0
of	0
things	1
including	0
being	0
single!	0
Sometimes	0
it's	0
helpful	0
to	0
compare	0
what	0
you	0

getting	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
relationship	0
to	0
what	0
you	0

about	0
what	0

a	0

time	0

Hello	1

Guilt	0

it	0

However	1
I	0
will	0

you	0
some	0

hopefully	0
this	0
will	0
help.One	0
of	0
the	0
things	0
that	0
we	0
know	0
about	0
guilt	0
is	0
that	0
it	0
doesn't	0
usually	0
do	0
much	0
to	0

in	0
the	0
long-run	2
People	0
may	0
make	0
changes	0
for	0

short-term	0
period	0
of	0
time	0
because	0
they	0
feel	0
guilty	0
about	0
something	0

they	0

how	0
you	0

But	0
if	0
this	0

true	1
he	0
needs	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0
so	0
you	0
can	0

I	0
suggest	0
that	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
when	0

you're	0
"okay"	0

perhaps	0

for	0

though	0
(even	0
if	0
you	0
end	0
up	0

due	0

your	0

Hi	0
there, I	0
hear	0
you	1
PTSD	0
has	0
a	0
very debilitating	0
effect	0
on	0
your	0
whole	0
life	2
I	0
know	0
that	0
from	0
personal	0
experience	2
Recovering	0
from	0
it	0
is	0
possible	0
and	0
doable! First	0
is	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
to	0
yourself	0
that	0
your	0
PTSD	0
symptoms	0
are	0
a	0
normal	0
reaction	0
to	0
an	0
abnormal	0
and	0
traumatic	0
event	2
The	0
nightmares	1
the	0
anxiety	1
the	0
heightened	0

response	0
-	0
are	0
all	0
typical	0
human	0
responses	0
following	0
exposure	0
to	0
a	0
frightening	0
event	2
It's	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
don't	0
blame	0
yourself	0
or	0
your	0
body	0
for	0
reacting	0
this	0
way	1
rather	0
approach	0
yourself	0
with compassion and	0
kindness	0
that	0
you	0
would	0
extend	0
a friend who	0
is	0
hurting. The	0
second step	0
is	0
to	0
start	0
taking	0
steps	0
towards	0
healing	2
I	0
would	0
really	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
counselor	0
or	0
therapist	0
specializing	0
in	0
trauma	0
recovery	0
so	0
that	0

if	0
this	0

an	0

you	0
can	0
begin	0

This	0
may	0
sound	0
counter-intuitive	1

sometimes	0
we	0
do	0
things	0
that	0
on	0
the	0

may	0
look	0
problematic	0
(or	0

A	0

somebody	0
who	0

may	0

may	0
even	0

I'd	0

I	0
learned	0
from	0
Randy	0
Rausch	0
(author	0
of The	0
Last	0
Lecture) called	0
The	0
3-Step	0
Apology.	0
I	0
teach	0
this	0
important	0
bit	0
of	0
wisdom	0
to	0
my	0
clients	0
when	0
they	0
need	0
to	0
apologize	0
to	0
someone	0
else	0
but	0
more	0
importantly	0
when	0
they	0
need	0
to	0
forgive	0
themselves.Yes	1
when	0
we	0
have	0
trouble	0
forgiving	0
ourselves	0
we	0
sometimes	0
forget	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
part	0
of	0
us	0
that	0
just	0
doesn't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
apologize	0
effectively.	0
Here	0
goes:Step	0
One:	0
Say	0
what	0
you	0
did	0
and	0
the	0
damage	0
it	0
caused.Step	0
Two:	0
Say	0
you're	0
sorry	0
and	0
accept	0
full	0
responsibility	0
(no	0
excuses	1
no	0
explanation	1
no	0
defensiveness:	0
“It	0
was	0
all	0
my	0
fault.”)Step	0
Three:	0
Ask	0
what	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
to	0
repair	0
the	0
damage.Step	0
Three	0
is	0
the	0
one	0
many	0
of	0
us	0
didn’t	0
learn	0
growing	0
up	2
And	0
when	0
we	0
add	0
it	0
to	0
an	0
apology	1
we	0
are	0
usually	0
surprised	0
that	0
the	0
penalty	0
is	0
as	0
light	0
as	0
it	0
is	2
Of	0
course	1
sometimes	0
the	0
apology	0
is	0
not	0
accepted	0
and	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
atone	0
is	0
offered	2
So	0
be	0
it	1
we	0
can’t	0
control	0
this	2
But	0
if	0
we	0
are	0
apologizing	0
to	0
ourselves	1
we	0
can	2
There	0
is	0
always	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
make	0
amends	0
if	0
we	0
put	0
our	0
heart	0
into	0
it	2
Give	0
this	0
a	0
try	0
the	0
next	0
time	0
you’re	0
reluctant	0
to	0
let	0
yourself	0
off	0
the	0
hook	2
You	0
might	0
surprise	0
yourself	0
when	0
how	0
benevolent	0
you	0
can	0
be	0
when	0
invited	2
Sometimes	0
changes	0
make	0
sense	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0

question	2
I	0
think	0
the	0
most	0

what	0
you	0
mentioned	0
was	0
that	0
you	0
do	0
it	0
because	0
it	0
makes	0
you	0
happy	2
For	0
that	0
reason	1
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
keep	0
doing	0
what	0
makes	0
you	0
happy.As	0
far	0
as	0
telling	0
girls	0
or	0
keeping	0
it	0
a	0
secret	1
I	0
don't	0
really	0
think	0
that	0
it's	0
necessarily	0
one	0
or	0
the	0
other	1
at	0
least	0
not	0
the	0
first	0
time	0
that	0
you	0
meet	2
In	0
other	0
words	1
one	0
part	0
of	0
your	0
decision-making	0
could	0
be	0
whether	0
it	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
you	0
always	0
want	0
to	0
address	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
date	1
or	0
perhaps	0
something	0
that	0
you	0
address	0
after	0
you've	0
known	0
each	0
other	0
for	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
meetings	2
The	0
answer	0
to	0
that	0
question	0
may	0
also	0
change	0
depending	0
on	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
dating	2
I	0
would	0
imagine	0
that	0
each	0
person	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
with	0
mainly	0
due	0
to	0
a	0
different	0
decision	0
this	0
was	0
when	0
to	0
disclose	0
this. It	0
sounds	0
like	0
this	0
is	0
an	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
you	1
so	0
I	0
would	0
think	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
were	0
going	0
to	0
date	0
someone	0
long-term	1
you	0
would	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
know	0
about	0
the	0
most	0
important	0
parts	0
of	0
you	1
including	0
that.I	0
also	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
remember	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
meet	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
not	0
comfortable	0
with	0
this	1
that	0
does	0
not	0
mean	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
anything	0
wrong	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
doing	1
but	0
rather	0
something	0
that	0
the	0
other	0
person	0
is	0
in	0
some	0
way	0
deciding	0
not	0
to	0
continue	0
learning	0
about	0
or	0
choosing	0
to	0
have	0
someone	0
they	0
are	0
dating	0
like	0
to	0
cross-dress.I'd	0
also	0
ask	0
you	0
to	0
consider	0
this:	0
Are	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
you	0
say	0
this	0
to	0
expecting	0
it	3
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
the	0
answer	0
is	0
probably	0
not	2
Along	0
with	0
that	1
Are	0
they	0
going	0
to	0
have	0
questions	3
I	0
would	0
imagine	0
so.Are	0
you	0
comfortable	0
answering	0
questions?I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0
could	0
figure	0
out	0
yourself	0
or	0
with	0
friends	0
(or	0
perhaps	0
even	0
with	0
a	0
therapist)	0
how	0
you	0
would	0
answer	0
these	0
sorts	0
of	0
questions:What	0
exactly	0
is	0
cross-dressing?Does	0
that	0
change	0
the	0
gender	0
that	0
you're	0
attracted	0
to?What	0
does	0
it	0
mean	0
to	0
you?Why	0
is	0
it	0
important	0
to	0
you?And	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
your	0
listening	0
person	0
to	0
know	0
about	0
you	0
related	0
to	0
cross-dressing.There	0
could	0
even	0
be	0
ways	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
start	0
the	0
conversation	0
by	0
asking	0
them	0
to	0
be	0
open	0
to	0

any	0

decisions	0
about	0

the	0
relationship.I	0
certainly	0
hope	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
the	0
right	0
person	0
for	0
you	2
I	0
imagine	0
that	0

the	0
idea	0
that	0

Remember	0
that	0

Hi	0
Cleveland	1
I	0
think	0
I	0
get	0
what	0
you're	0
feeling	2
You're	0
scared	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
forgive	0
your	0
mom	1
that	0
would	0
mean	0
it	0
wasn't	0
so	0
bad	1
or	0
she'll	0
think	0
it's	0
okay	0
to	0
do	0
it	0
again	1
or	0
she	0
won't	0
realize	0
how	0
hurt	0
you	0
are. I	0
invite	0
you	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
forgiveness	0
in	0
a	0
different	0
way	2
Forgiveness	0
doesn't	0
have	0
to	0
mean	0
what	0
she	0
did	0
was	0
okay	2
Not	0
at	0
all	2
Forgiveness	0
can	0
mean	0
"I	0
accept	0
what	0
she	0
did	1
and	0
I	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
live	0
in	0
her	0
worst	0
moments	0
constantly	2
I	0
want	0
to	0
put	0
it	0
down	0
and	0
move	0
past	0
it	0
because	0
I	0
want	0
her	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
because	0
fear	0
and	0
resentment	0
interfere	0
with	0
my	0
relationship	0
with	0
her	1
and	0
mostly	0
because	0
I'm	0
tired	0
of	0
carrying	0
them	0
(fear	0
and	0
resentment)	0
around	0
constantly."You	0
can	0
forgive	0
your	0
mom	0
for	0
yourself	1
not	0
for	0
her.  If	0
there	0
is	0
evidence	0
that	0
your	0
mom	0
wants	0
to	0
respect	0
you	0
moving	0
forward	1
then	0
it	0
might	0
be	0
worth	0
it	0
to	0
risk	0
putting	0
down	0
the	0
resentment	0
and	0
the	0
grudge	0
that	0
you	0
think	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
protect	0
yourself.  Your	0
ability	0
to	0
draw	0
boundaries	0
with	0
her	0
in	0
the	0
present	0
is	0
your	0
biggest	0
protector;	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
in	0
the	0
present	0
what	0
hurts	0
you	1
and	0
notice	0
her	0
responses.You	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
say	0
it	0
to	0
her	0
face	2
Saying	0
it	0
to	0
yourself	0
is	0
more	0
important	2
Again	1
forgiving	0
your	0
mom	0
helps	0
you...it	0
reduces	0
your	0
own	0
burden	0
of	0
fear	0
and	0
resentment	1
leaving	0
space	0
for	0
better	0
things	2
Yes	0
it	0
is	0
absolutely	0
normal! 	0
A	0
good	0
therapist	0
can	0
help	0
your	0
feel	0
safe	0
enough	0
to	0
really	0
identify	0
painful	0
wounds. 	0
There	0
are	0
some	0
things	0
that	0
need	0
to	0
be	0
cried	0
about	0
before	0
they	0
can	0
heal. 	0
Therapists	0
are	0
fine	0
with	0
tears	0
and	0
buy	0
tissues	0
by	0
the	0
case.  That	0
said	1
if	0
you	0
don't	0
cry	0
during	0
therapy	0
it	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
you	0
are	0
doing	0
it	0
"wrong". 	0
As	0
long	0
as	0
you	0
feel	0
safe	0
and	0
have	0
a	0
sense	0
that	0
your	0
therapist	0
"gets	0
you"	1
and	0
you	0
feel	0
progress	0
during	0
your	0
course	0
of	0
treatment	1
you	0
are	0
doing	0
therapy	0
"right"!	0
Feelings	0
of	0
anxiety	0
can	0
be	0
scary	0
and	0
sometimes	0
we're	0
not	0
aware	0
of	0
the	0
triggers	0
that	0
lead	0
up	0
to	0
moments	0
of	0
anxiety	1
i	2
e.	1
heart	0

shortness	0

It's	0
important	0
to	0
realize	0
that	0
in	0
moments	0
of	0
anxiety	0
our	0
body	0
&	0
mind	0
are	0
experiencing	0
a	0
reaction	0
from	0
our	0
primal	0
or	0
reptilian	0
brain	0
that	0
is	0
signaling	0
the	0
flight	0
or	0
fight	0
response	0
within	0
us	1
which	0
kicks	0
the	0
hypothalamus	0
into	0
action	0
flooding	0
our	0
body	0
with	0
chemicals	1
like	0
adrenaline	0
or	0
cortisol	2
 So	1
one	0
way	0
to	0
work	0
with	0
anxiety	0
is	0
to	0
find	0
out	0
what	0
the	0
triggers	0
are	0
that	0
lead	0
to	0
anxiety	1
such	0
as	0
fear	1
stress	2
negative	0
thought	0
patterns	1
not	0
enough	0
food	0
or	0
sleep	2
Keeping	0
a	0
daily	0
journal	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
track	0
the	0
patterns	0
and	0
triggers	0
and	0
once	0
you	0
identify	0
the	0
triggers	0
you	0
can	0
ameliorate	0
them	0
by	0
learning	0
new	0
skills	0
&	0
techniques	0
and	0
by	0
reducing	0
stress	0
and	0
getting	0
enough	0
sleep	2
One	0
quick	0
way	0
to	0
reduce	0
anxiety	0
is	0
by	0
taking	0
deeper	0
breathes	1
sometimes	0
this	0
is	0
called	0
belly	0

When	0
you	0

But	0
if	0
this	0

true	1
he	0
needs	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
that	0
so	0
you	0
can	0

I	0
suggest	0
that	0
the	0
fact	0
that	0
when	0

you're	0

Listen	0

encourage	0

your	0

for	0

to	0
consider	0
what	0
is	0

you	0
unhappy	0

this	0

then	0
we	0
regret	0
it. 	0
The	0
worst	0
thing	0

to	0
have	0

Take	0
time	0
to	0
do	0
some	0

imagine	0
your	0

of	0
the	0

things	0
about	0

that	0

the	0
reason	0

Hi	2
 This	0
is	0
an	0

question	0

 	0
I	0
think	0

the	0

probably	0
varies	0

the	0

therapist	0
 In	0
my	0

with	0

once	0
we	0
have	0

the	0
person'a	0

the	0
issues	0
they	0
want	0
help	0
with	0
I	0
spend	0
the	0
next	0

sessions	0
gathering	0
as	0

about	0

to	0
formulate	0
some	0

Not	0

This	0
may	0

at	0

that	0

reach	0
out	0
and	0
talk	0
to	0
someone	0
about	0

I	0
get	0
the	0
sense	0
that	0
you	0

that	0
you	0

alone	0
in	0

and	0
having	0
someone	0
there	0
to	0

out	0

Such	0
a	0

question!	0
I'm	0

Intrusive	0
thoughts	2
 These	0
are	0
thoughts	0
that	0
seem	0
to	0
come	0
from	0
no	0
where	0
and	0
victimize	0
us	2
 I	0
can	0
strongly	0
recommend	0
a	0
book	0
called	0
"When	0
Panic	0
Attacks"	0
by	0
Dr	2
David	0
Burns	2
 It	0
helps	0
you	0
to	0
identify	0
the	0
thoughts	1
and	0
the	0
help	0
you	0
create	0
ways	0
to	0
counteract	0
them!	0
 There	0
is	0
another	0
technique	1
called	0
Thought	0
Stopping	2
Thought	0
Stopping	0
can	0
be	0
as	0
simple	0
as	0
saying	0
"Stop!"	0
loudly	0
(if	0
you	0
are	0
alone)	0
or	0
in	0
your	0
head	1
if	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
public	2
 It's	0
a	0
quick	0
way	0
to	0
distract	0
you	0
from	0
the	0
distressing	0
thought	1
and	0
allow	0
you	0
to	0
refocus	2
 I	0
recommend	0
using	0
this	0
technique	1
followed	0
by	0
some	0
deep	0
breathing	1
while	0
visualizing	0
something	0
that	0
helps	0
you	0
feel	0
relaxed	0
(a	0
favorite	0
place	1
a	0
pet	1
etc.)	2
 These	0
three	0
things	0
in	0
conjunction	0
can	0
be	0
of	0
great	0
assistance. One	0
key	0
component	0
in	0
addressing	0
anxious	0
thinking	0
is	0
building	0
the	0
skill	0
of	0
relaxation	2
 I	0
recommend	0
an	0
App	0
called	0
Headspace	0
which	0
teaches	0
relaxation	0
through	0
some	0
simple	0
guided	0
mediation	2
Super	0
easy	0
to	0
do	1
and	0
a	0
great	0
way	0
to	0
begin	0
to	0
build	0
relaxation	0
skills	2
 Plenty	0
of	0
sleep	0
and	0
reducing	0

things	0

Sexuality	0
is	0
normally	0

rare	0
for	0
someone	0
to	0
develop	0
feelings	0
of	0
same-sex	0
attraction	0
later	0
in	0
life	2
I	0
would	0
explore	0
whether	0
the	0

Hello	1
I	0
commend	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
courage	0
in	0
taking	0
a	0
look	0
at	0
the	0
role	0
alcohol	0
has	0
in	0
your	0
life	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you're	0
concerned	0
about	0
what	0
happens	0
when	0
you	0
drink	0
too	0
much	0
and	0
I	0
suspect	0
you	0
already	0
know	0
the	0
answer	0
to	0
your	0
question	0
about	0
whether	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
problem	0
or	0
not	2
I	0
imagine	0
you	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
stop	0
feeling	0
guilty	0
and	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
avoid	0
cheating	0
on	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
or	0
other	0
negative	0
consequences	0
and	0
maybe	0
have	0
a	0
fear	0
of	0
being	0
or	0
becoming	0
an	0
"addict"	0
or	0
"alcoholic."	0
You	0
might	0
have	0
a	0
"problem"	0
but	0
that	0
does	0
not	0
necessarily	0
mean	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
an	0
addict. I	0
don't	0
have	0
information	0
to	0
know	0
if	0
"addiction"	0
or	0
"dependence"	0
or	0
other	0
words	0
would	0
best	0
describe	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
with	0
drinking	1
but	0
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
it's	0
begun	0
to	0
have	0
some	0
negatives	1
so	0
forgive	0
me	0
using	0
words	0
like	0
addict	1
dependence	0
and	0
so	0
on	2
I	0
mean	0
it	0
more	0
as	0
a	0
road	0
map	0
than	0
a	0
diagnosis	2
The	0
feedback	0
I'm	0
writing	0
here	0
is	0
very	0
general	0
and	0
doesn't	0
address	0
physical	0
dependence	0
and	0
many	0
other	0
factors	0
that	0
might	0
apply	0
to	0
your	0
situation	2
 One	0
of	0
the	0
ways	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
substance	0
(mis)use	0
is	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
addiction	0
as	0
a	0
disease	0
of	0
avoidance	2
Let	0
me	0
repeat	0
that:	0
it	0
is	0
a	0
disease	0
of	0
avoidance	2
Your	0
ultimate	0
task	0
in	0
living	0
a	0
balanced	0
life	0
is	0
to	0
figure	0
out	0
what	0
you're	0
avoiding	0
and	0
develop	0
other	0
ways	0
to	0
manage	0
those	0
feelings	1
experiences	1

so	0
on	2
And	0
of	0

planning	0
and	0
so	0
on	2
Depending	0
on	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
your	0
drinking	1
you	0
might	0
very	0
well	0
benefit	0
from	0
expertise	0
and	0
support. Remember	0
also	0
that	0
alcohol	0
depresses	0
our	0
central	0
nervous	0
system	0
and	0
disinhibits	0
us	2
That	0
means	0
that	0
alcohol	0
is	0
often	0
a	0
substance	0
of	0
choice	0
to	0
relax	1
destress	1
calm	0
down	1

Also	1
it	0
allows	0
feelings	1

that	0

If	0

your	0

and	0
then	0
get	0
angry	1
you	0

I	0

therapy	0

allow	0
us	0

For	0
some	0

the	0

that	0
the	0

more	0
about	0

do	0
cry	0
in	0

your	0

won't	0
be	0
uneasy	0
with	0
this	2
 Crying	0
is	0
a	0
natural	0
response	0

it	0
also	0

some	0

your	0

if	0
there's	0
something	0

just	0
say	1
"I'm	0
not	0

about	0

 Your	0
counselor	0
wants	0
 you	0

feel	0
at	0
ease	0

will	0
probably	0
not	0
push	0
you	0
right	0

a	0
very	0

 As	0
you	0
get	0

you	0
will	0
feel	0
more	0

even	0
not	0
worry	0
so	0
much	0
about	0
how	0
you	0

there	0

new	0
skills	0
you	0
can	0

to	0
work	0
with	0

types	0
of	0
thoughts	2
The	0
first	0
step	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
scary	0
or	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
is	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
just	0
thoughts	0
and	0
we	0
can	0
choose	0
to	0
follow	0
the	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	0
or	0
work	0
with	0
cutting	0
them	0
off	0
or	0
ignoring	0
them	2
I	0
also	0
realize	0
that	0
might	0
seem	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
do	1
but	0
here's	0
a	0
good	0
way	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
brain	0
and	0
how	0
thought	0
patterns	0
work	2
Thoughts	0
arise	0
in	0
the	0
mind	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
our	0
brain	0
is	0
a	0
thought	0
machine	2
Many	0
thoughts	0
drift	0
by	0
like	0
clouds	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	0
while	0
other	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
and	0
they	0
trigger	0
us	0
in	0
a	0
particulate	0
way	1
i.e.	1
scary	1
angry	1
happy	1
sad	1
and	0
when	0
those	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
we	0
can	0
chose	0
to	0
pay	0
more	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
which	0
can	0
lead	0
us	0
down	0
that	0
particulate	0
thought	0
stream	0
that	0
will	0
lead	0
to	0
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	2
So	1
how	0
do	0
we	0
work	0
or	0
stop	0
those	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	3
One	0
new	0
skill	0
to	0
implement	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
work	0
of	0
Rick	0
Hansen	1
he	0
wrote	0
the	0
book	0
Buddha's	0
Brain,"	0
he	0
teaches	0
that	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
give	0
more	0
energy	0
and	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
positive	0
thoughts	0
or	0
positive	0
memories	0
we	0
hold	0
in	0
our	0
mind	0
and	0
pay	0
less	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	2
Hansen	0
asks	0
us	0
to	0
imagine	0
the	0
brain	0
this	0
way	1
the	0
brain	0
is	0
like	0
Velcro	0
with	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
and	0
like	0
teflon	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
positive	0
thoughts	2
There	0
are	0
reasons	0
that	0
our	0
brain	0
works	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
I	0
don't	0
have	0
time	0
to	0
go	0
into	0
all	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
this	0
response	2
So	1
it's	0
just	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
positive	0
thinking	1
actually	0

The	0

next	0
steps:Aside	0
from	0
the	0
sex	1
is	0
your	0

What	0
are	0

Does	0

Does	0

If	0

your	0

in	0
her	0

my	0
opinion	1
if	0
couple's	0
therapy	0
hasn't	0

it's	0
time	0
for	0
your	0
wife	0
to	0
own	0
whatever	0
is	0
blocking	0
her	0
and	0
address	0
it	0
with	0
her	0
physician	0

Let	0
her	0

the	0
way	0

The	0
most	0
important	0
word	0
here	0
is	0
"sometimes."	0
I	0
know	0
it	0
is	0
quite	0
painful	1
and	0
I	0
can	0
imagine	0
that	0
at	0
times	0
this	0
pain	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
like	0
it	0

subside	2
But	0
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
it	0
is	0
not	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
which	0
means	0
we	0
can	0
easily	0
say	0
that	0
this	0
"hate	0
myself"	0
experience	0
is	0
one	0
part	0
of	0
you	2
There	0
are	0
many	0
other	0
parts	1
if	0
you	0
give	0
them	0
some	0
space	0
to	0
also	0
"speak	0
up,"	0
that	0
will	0
offer	0
you	0
more	0
positive	0
regard	1
trust	0
me	0
on	0
that	2
Generally	0
speaking	1
we	0
just	0
don't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
listen	0
to	0
those	0
parts	1
because......it	0
is	0
the	0
"I	0
hate	0
myself"	0
part	0
that	0
is	0
our	0
inner	0
critic	2
And	0
often	1
our	0
inner	0
critic	0
has	0
developed	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
strength	0
throughout	0
our	0
life	0
because	0
of	0
how	0
we've	0
depended	0
on	0
it	0
for	0
certain	0
things	2
Sounds	0
crazy	1
but	0
in	0
actuality	1
some	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
"successful"	0
people	1
in	0
work	0
mainly	1
are	0
those	0
that	0
have	0
strong	0
inner	0
critics	2
They	0
use	0
these	0
critics	0
to	0
motivate	0
themselves	1

with	0
people	1
and	0
in	0
relationships	1
and	0
in	0
our	0
relationship	0
with	0
ourselves	1
it	0
completely	0
backfires	1
because	0
relationships	0
are	0
far	0
more	0

Hello	2
Being	0
unable	0
to	0
trust	0
your	0
significant	0
other	0
certainly	0
can	0
cause	0
one	0
to	0
feel	0
unsettled	2
Has	0
your	0
spouse	0
ever	0
done	0
anything	0
questionable	0
that	0
would	0
cause	0
you	0
to	0
not	0
trust	0
her	3
If	0
so	1
then	0
it	0
will	0
take	0
time	0
and	0
some	0
work	0
to	0
gain	0
the	0

If	0

then	0
you	0
may	0

to	0

seeing	0
a	0
therapist	0
on	0
your	0
own	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
better	0
learn	0
where	0
your	0

There	0
are	0
several	0
possible	0
reasons	0
why	0

without	0
knowing	0
them	1
the	0
issue	0
is	0
not	0
likely	0
to	0
get	0
resolved	2
In	0
the	0

I	0
suggest	0
that	0
when	0
you're	0
feeling	0
upset	0
and	0
are	0
unable	0
to	0
trust	0
what	0
your	0
wife	0
says/does	1
think	0
before	0
you	0
speak	2
Ask	0
yourself	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
valid	0
reasons	0
to	0
not	0
trust	0
her	2
Instead	0
of	0
arguing	1
try	0
and	0
communicate	0
how	0
you're	0
feeling	0
and	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
resolving	0
this	0
trust	0
issue	0
will	0
be	0
a	0
top	0
priority	0
for	0
you	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
focus	0

Hi	0
there, Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
It's	0
absolutely	0
ok	0
to	0
feel	0
nervous	0
going	0
to	0
therapy	2
I	0
have	0
experienced	0
anxiety	0
going	0
to	0
see	0
my	0
own	0
therapist	2
There	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
few	0
reasons	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
this	0
way. First	1
it	0
is	0
always	0
unnerving	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
person	0
who	0
is	0
a	0
stranger	0
and	0
to	0
share	0
intimate	0
things	0
with	0
that	0
stranger	2
You	0
mentioned	0
it	0
has	0
only	0
been	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
sessions	2
Your	0
anxiety	0
might	0
subside	0
as	0
you	0
continue	0
to	0
see	0
your	0
therapist	0
and	0
grow	0
more	0
comfortable	0
with	0
him/her. Another	0
reason	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
particularly	0
nervous	0
is	0
perhaps	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
comfortable	0
sharing	0
things	2
As	0
children	1
we	0
might	0
have	0
bad	0
experiences	0
opening	0
up	0
to	0
others	2
Someone	0
might	0
bully	0
or	0
ridicule	0
us	1
and	0
that	0
experience	0
can	0
stay	0
with	0
us	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
making	0
it	0
extra	0
scary	0
to	0
share	0
our	0
intimate	0
feelings	0
and	0
thoughts	0
with	0
others	2
If	0
this	0
the	0
case	1
as	0
you	0
continue	0
with	0
your	0
sessions	0
and	0
have	0
positive	0
interactions	0
with	0
your	0
therapists	1
this	0
anxiety	0
will	0
subside	0
with	0
time	0
and	0
you	0
will	0
re-learn	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
safe	0
to	0
share. And	0
the	0
last	0
thought	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
the	0
shakes	0
is	0
perhaps	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
some	0
past	0
experiences	0
or	0
memories	0
that	0
are	0
uncomfortable	0
and	0
difficult. Regardless	0
of	0
the	0
reason	1
it	0
might	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
bring	0
up	0
your	0
nervousness	0
in	0
your	0
session	0
and	0
share	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
with	0
your	0
therapist	2
Having	0
an	0
open	0
dialogue	0
about	0
your	0
anxiety	0

Hi	0
Houston	1
Okay	1
something's	0
definitely	0
going	0
on	1
right	3
My	0
gut	0
is	0
to	0
start	0
with	0
your	0
family	0
physician	1
because	0
you	0
have	0
some	0
physical	0
symptoms	2
While	0
it	0
seems	0
anxiety	0
is	0
a	0
likely	0
problem	0
here	1
your	0
doctor	0
will	0
hopefully	0
know	0
your	0
history	0
and	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
decide	0
if	0
you	0
need	0
some	0
medical	0
tests	0
or	0
some	0
therapy	2
Without	0
knowing	0
more	1
that's	0
all	0
I	0
can	0
say	0
at	0
this	0
point	2
Best	0
of	0
luck. 	0
If	0
your	0
therapist	0
is	0
attentive	0
and	0
compassionate	0
to	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
sharing	0
then	0
you	0
will	0
know	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
true	0
connection	0
with	0
him	0
or	0
her	0
and	0
that	0
he	0
or	0
she	0
is	0
the	0
right	0
match	0
for	0
you	2
Having	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
has	0
a	0
good	0
location	0
and	0
inviting	0
office	0
is	0
also	0
a	0
good	0
sign	0

the	0
right	0
one!	0
Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
I	0
am	0
very	0
sorry	0
that	0
this	0
was	0
your	0
experience	0
with	0
your	0
family	2
I	0
truly	0
wish	0
I could	0
give	0
you	0
some	0
things	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
them	0
that	0
would	0
change	0
their	0
reaction	1
but	0
unfortunately	0
I	0
can't	0
do	0
that	2
Their	0
acceptance	0
of	0
you is	0
a	0
journey	1
just	0
like	0
coming	0
out	0
is	0
a	0
journey	0
for	0
you	2
Sometimes	0
families	0
initially	0
respond	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
after	0
time	0
they	0
become	0
more	0
accepting	0
and	0
even	0
supportive	2
Unfortunately	1
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
know	0
for	0
sure	0
if	0
that	0
will	0
happen	2
So	1
here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
I	0
would	0
suggest:Surround	0
yourself	0
with	0
people	0
and	0
things	0
that	0
remind	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
really	0
are	0
okay	0
as	0
you	0
are	2
That	0
won't	0
take	0
the	0
place	0
of	0
your	0
family's	0
acceptance	1
and	0
I	0
won't	0
even	0
pretend	0
that	0
it	0
would	1
but	0
it	0
may	0
help	0
during	0
those	0
days	0
when	0
it	0
hurts	0
the	0
most	2
And	0
that	0
is	0
really	0
important	2
Patience	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
that	0
many	0
of	0
us	0
are	0
really	0
good	0
at	1
but	0
this	0
type	0
of	0
situation	0
sometimes	0
forces	0
you	0
to	0
have	0
some	2
When	0
families	0
first	0
learn	0
something	0
like	0
this	1
they	0
may	0
go	0
through	0
a	0
period	0
of	0
shock	2
And	0
then	0
sometimes	0
even	0
grieving	2
They	0
may	0
even	0
be	0
worried	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
of	0
a	0
particular	0
religion	0
where	0
being	0
bisexual	0
is	0
forbidden	2
These	0
things	0
can	0
take	0
time	0
for	0
them	0
to	0
reconcile	1
so	0
it	0
may	0
just	0
take	0
some	0
patience	2
If	0
it	0
is	0
safe	0
for	0
you	1
try	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
them	1
but	0
if	0
it	0
becomes	0
painful	0
or	0
hurtful	0
then	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
right	0
to	0
walk	0
away	2
I	0
do	0
recommend	0
setting	0
up some	0
personal	0
boundaries	0
for	0
yourself	1
and	0
perhaps	0
learn	0
some	0
assertiveness	0
skills	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
struggle	0
with	0
them	2
The	0
reason	0
I	0
feel	0
that	0
this	0
is	0
important	0
is	0
that	0
people	0
sometimes	0
take	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
abuse	0
from	0
family	0
members	0
and	0
friends	0
in	0
times	0
like	0
you're	0
describing	2
They	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
accepted	0
so	0
much	0
that	0
they	0
put	0
themselves	0
in	0
hurtful	0
positions	0
over	0
and	0
over	0
again	0
hoping	0
that	0
their	0
families	0
will	0
come	0
around	2
They	0
may	1
or	0
they	0
may	0
not	2
And	0
if	0
they	0
don't	1
you	0
deserve	0
to	0
live	0
a	0
life	0
free	0
of	0
abuse	0
and	0
to	0
feel	0
confident	0
and	0
assured	0
of	0
who	0
you	0
are	2
To	0
be	0
surrounded	0
by	0
folks	0
who	0
remind	0
you	0
of	0
that. If	0
you	0
start seeing	0
this	0
pattern	0
and	0
you	0
are	0
struggling	1
chatting	0
with counselor	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
great	0
idea	2
I	0
am	0
bias	0
probably	1

I	0
think	0
chatting	0
with	0
a	0

is	0
ALWAYS	0
a	0
good	0
idea	2

Finding	0
the	0
right	0
therapist	0
for	0
you	0
is	0
very	0
important	0
and	0
can	0
sometimes	0
be	0
tricky	2
It	0
can	0
sometimes	0
take	0
a	0
number	0
of	0
sessions	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
good	0
sense	0
of	0
whether	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
therapist	0
are	0
the	0
"right	0
fit." 	0
The	0
first	0
couple	0
of	0
sessions	0
are	0
generally	0
spent	0
on	0
gathering	0
information	1
formulating	0
a	0
plan	0
of	0
treatment	1
and	0
building	0
the	0
client/therapist	0
relationship	2
The	0
client/therapist	0
relationship	0
will	0
be	0
very	0
different	0
from	0
other	0
relationships	0
you	0
have	0
experienced. 	0
You	0
will	0
know	0
you	0

the	0
right	0
therapist	0
when	0
you	0
notice	0
there	0
is	0
a good	0
rapport	0
between	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you. 	0
You	0
will	0
get	0
a	0
sense	0
that	0
the	0
therapist	0
"gets	0
you"	0
and	0
understands	0
the	0
issues	0
being	0
presented	2
If	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
trust	0
your	0
therapist	0
and	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
opening	0
up	0
and	0
providing	0
feedback	0
during	0
your	0
sessions	0
then	0
you	0
know	0
it	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
fit. In	0
terms	0
of	0
"how	0

When	0
you	0
express	0
your	0

to	0
your	0

then	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you	0

my	0
recommendation	0

to	0
hold	0
off	0
on	0
presenting	0
your	0

with	0
a	0
personalized	0
gift	0

instead	0
focus	0

 Sometimes	0
the	0
element	0
of	0
power	0

can	0
heighten	0
our	0

that	0
doesn't	0

it's	0
a	0

idea	0
to	0
pursue	0

There	0
might	0
be	0
a	0

If	0

Hi	0
Fontana,Thanks	0
for	0
providing	0
all	0
the	0
details	0
needed	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
respond	0
to	0
your	0
question	2
It	0
seems	0
very	0
clear	0
to	0
me	0
that	0
"no"	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
appropriate	0
response	2
I	0
like	0
your	0
healthy	0
boundaries	1
and	0
I'll	0
help	0
you	0
explore	0
possible	0
ways	0
to	0
respond	0
to	0
her. First	1
she	0
hasn't	0
asked	0
yet	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
know	0
that	0
she	0
will	2
Right	0
now	1
you	0
can	0
pleasantly	0
ignore	0
her	0
hints	2
They're	0
not	0
hurting	0
you	0
and	0
if	0
you	0
ignore	0
them	1
they're	0
more	0
likely	0
to	0
go	0
away	2
You	0
can	0
address	0
and	0
reduce	0
your	0
own	0
anxiety	0
about	0
the	0
possibility	0
of	0
her	0
asking	0
by	0
reassuring	0
yourself	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
right	0
as	0
parents	0
to	0
make	0
this	0
decision	1
and	0
that	0
if	0
she's	0
offended	1
that	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
that	0
you're	0
being	0
mean;	0
it	0
means	0
that	0
she	0
has	0
unrealistic	0
expectations	2
So	1
the	0
first	0
goal	0
is	0
to	0
put	0
it	0
out	0
of	0
your	0
mind	0
as	0
a	0
worry	2
You	0
might	0
never	0
have	0
to	0
face	0
that	0
moment	2
But	1
I	0
understand	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
prepared.As	0
her	0
son	1
perhaps	0
your	0
husband	0
is	0
the	0
best	0
one	0
to	0
answer	0
the	0
question	1
should	0
it	0
ever	0
come	2
Is	0
he	0
willing	0
to	0
do	0
this	3
But	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
comfortable	1
and	0
if	0
you're	0
the	0
one	0
she	0
asks	1
you	0
can	0
confidently	0
give	0
her	0
a	0
simple	1
honest	0
response	0
about	0
why	0
it	0
won't	0
happen	2
And	0
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
presenting	0
a	0
firmly	0
closed	0
door	1
rather	0

counselling	2
In	0

most	0

have	0
more	0

on	0
in	0
psychotherapy	0

most	0

are	0
all	0

In	0
counselling	1
we	0
work	0
together	1
collaboratively	1
to	0
figure	0
out	0
which	0
issues	0
you	0
would	0
like	0
to	0
address	0
first	0
and	0
then	0
together	0
we	0
develop	0
an	0
individualized	0
plan	0
of	0
care	2
Basically	1
it’s	0
like	0
a	0
road	0
map	0
of	0
where	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
go	1
how	0
are	0
you	0

some	0

others	0
possibly	0
not	0
so	0
scenic	1
however	1
necessary	2
Of	0
course	1
these	0

can	0
also	0
change	0
due	0

internal	0
(what	0
we	0

(those	0

I	0

reach	0
out	0
to	0
a	0

you	0

and	0
build	0
rapport	0
with	0
by	0
co-journeying	0
through	0
whatever	0

you	0
have	0
by	0
examining	0
what	0
has	0
been	0

Hi	0
Helena,I	0
felt	0
a	0
bit	0
sad	0
when	0
I	0
read	0
this	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
new	0
term	0
for	0
me..	2
"semi-relationship"	2
What	0
does	0
it	0
mean	3
I	0
know	0
that	0
today's	0
culture	0
for	0
young	0
people	0
is	0
more	0
of	0
a	0
"hook-up"	0
culture	0
than	0
a	0
dating	0
one	2
Maybe	0
that	0
means	0
that	0
you	0
develop	0
connections	0
to	0
people	0
but	0
you	0
keep	0
yourself	0
from	0
hoping	0
for	0
a	0
full	0
relationship	0
because	0
no	0
one	0
is	0
doing	0
that	0
anymore	2
That	0
makes	0
me	0
feel	0
sad	2
I	0
hear	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
young	0
women	0
(I'm	0
not	0
sure	0
you're	0
female	1
but	0
that's	0
my	0
guess)	0
say	0
that	0
they	0
struggle	0
with	0
hook-ups	0
because	0
they	0
can't	0
let	0
themselves	0
hope	0
for	0
a	0
phone	0
call	0
after	0
a	0
hook-up	2
Research	0
tells	0
us	0
that	1
after	0
a	0
hook-up	1
college	0
age	0
women	0
tend	0
to	0
feel	0
used	0
and	0
unworthy	1
and	0
men	0
tend	0
to	0
feel	0
guilty	2
I	0
think	0
this	0
scenario	0
works	0
better	0
for	0
men	0
than	0
women	1
but	0
many	0
of	0
both	0
genders	0
are	0
left	0
unsatisfied	0
in	0
the	0
end.This	0
is	0
only	0
one	0
possible	0
explanation	0
for	0
your	0
anxiety...that	0
your	0
gut	0
knows	0
that	0
it	0
wants	0
to	0
feel	0
fully	0
coupled	0
with	0
someone	0
but	0
you	0
struggle	0
with	0
whether	0
it's	0
okay	0
to	0
want	0
or	0
expect	0
that.Maybe	0
take	0
a	0
moment	0
and	0
listen	0
to	0
anxiety	2
Anxiety	0
tends	0
to	0
try	0
to	0
convince	0
us	0
that	0
something's	0
wrong	0
with	0
us	0
or	0
something	0
bad's	0
going	0
to	0
happen	2
Anxiety	0
sometimes	0
prefers	0
to	0
stay	0
vague	0
(it's	0
more	0
difficult	0
to	0
refute	0
it	0
then)	1
but	0
you	0
can	0
try	0
to	0
clarify	0
it's	0
whisperings	0
by	0
asking	0
yourself	0
these	0
questions:	0
What	0
am	0
I	0
afraid	0

what	0

what	0

that	3
Keep	0
going	0
until	0
you	0
find	0
the	0
very	0
worst	0
thing	0
that	0
might	0

Might	0
someone	0

you...might	0

when	0

you	0
can	0

find	0
a	0

where	0
that	0

A	0

In	0
the	0

it's	0
a	0
feeling	0
you're	0
trying	0

(not	0

Hello	1
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
will	0
never	0

your	0

decides	0
to	0

upfront	0
about	0
the	0

for	0
sure	0
though	1
not	0
knowing	0
and	0
having	0
this	0
uncertainty	0

your	0

your	0
husband	0
and	0
you	0
further	0
away	0
from	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
repair	0
the	0
marriage. 	0
The	0
best	0
thing	0

seek	0

this	0

your	0

Hi, Different	0
therapists	0
are	0
guided	0
by	0
the	0
ethical	0
guidelines	0
of	0
their	0
own	0
associations	0
or	0
colleges	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
receiving	0
gifts	1
so	0
this	0
may	0
differ	0
a	0
bit	0
from	0
therapist	0
to	0
therapist	2
It's	0
important	0
to	0
me	0
that	0
I	0
be	0
sensitive	0
to	0
cultural	0
norms	1
and	0
to	0
my	0
client's	0
needs	2
In	0
Canada	1
and	0
the	0
US	1
it	0
is	0
customary	0
for	0
people	0
to	0
sometimes	0
express	0
gratitude	0
with	0
a	0
small	0
gift	1
and	0
I	0
have	0
from	0
time	0
to	0
time	0
received	0
small	0
tokens	0
of	0
appreciation	0
because	0
I	0
believe	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
rude	0
to	0
refuse	0
this	2
It	0
is	0
never	0
necessary	0
to	0
give	0
a	0
therapist	0
a	0
gift	1
but	0
if	0
you	0
wish	0
to	0
express	0
your	0
gratitude	0
in	0
this	0
way	1
I	0
don't	0
think	0
it's	0
inappropriate. 	0
Hi	0
California,I'm	0
happy	0
to	0
hear	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
hold	0
of	0
this	0
problem	2
Relationships	0
don't	0
tend	0
to	0
last	0
when	0
we	0
treat	0
people	0
poorly	2
It	0
is	0
very	0
possible	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
learn	0
different	0
ways	0
of	0
relating	1
with	0
some	0
strong	0
effort	2
I	0
would	0
highly	0
suggest	0
working	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	1
and	0
I	0
will	0
give	0
you	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
in	0
the	0
interim.Sometimes	0
anger	0
is	0
there	0
because	0
we	0
feel	0
something	0
is	0
unjust	0
or	0
unfair	1
but	0
many	0
times	1
anger	0
is	0
a	0
"secondary	0
emotion"	1
and	0
it's	0
simply	0
there	0
to	0
protect	0
us	0
from	0
other	1
more	0
vulnerable	0
emotions	0
that	0
we	0
would	0
rather	0
not	0
feel	0
and	0
will	0
do	0
anything	0
to	0
avoid	2
Discovering	0
what	0
vulnerable	0
emotions	0
you	0
are	0
protecting	0
yourself	0
from	0
is	0
important	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
feel	0
powerless	1
or	0
unloved	1
or	0
unimportant	2
It	0
may	0
take	0
some	0
time	0
before	0
you	0
recognise	0
this	0
emotion. Once	0
you	0
do	1
you	0
can	0
ask	0
yourself	0
about	0
the	0
other	0
times	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
felt	0
that	0
emotion	2
Where	0
did	0
it	0
originate	3
At	0
what	0
age	0
did	0
you	0
feel	0
"too	0
much"	0
of	0
that	0
feeling...so	0
much	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
can't	0
stand	0
it	0
even	0
in	0
tiny	0
amounts?You	0
will	0
learn	0
in	0
therapy	0
to	0
identify	0
the	0
thoughts	0
you	0
have	0
that	0
are	0
connected	0
to	0
that	0
feeling	2
They	0
are	0
typically	0
incorrect	0
thoughts	1
like	0
"No	0
one	0
lifes	0
me"	1
or	0
"People	0
will	0
always	0
hurt	0
me"	2
Fear	0
tends	0
to	0
generalize	0
and	0
predict	0
bad	0
things	0
that	0
aren't	0
likely.Your	0
habit	0
is	0
so	0
strong	0
that	0
you	0
likely	0
have	0
a	0
poor	0
sense	0
of	0
self-worth	0
and	0
you	0
don't	0
believe	0
people	0
will	0
love	0
you...so	0
you	0
hurt	0
them	0
to	0
keep	0
them	0
at	0
a	0
distance	2
This	0
happens	0
in	0
a	0
subconscious	0
level	2
Do	0
you	0
see	0
how	0
that	0
would	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
keep	0
people	0
off	0
balance	0
or	0
afraid	0
or	0
a	0
distance	0
away	0
if	0
you	0
didn't	0
believe	0
in	0
your	0

So	1
it's	0
backwards	0
really	1

you	0

you're	0

you're	0
really	0

you	0
are	0

should	0

from	0
the	0

session	2
What	0
I	0
mean	0
by	0
that	0

there	0
should	0
be	0
an	0
understanding	0
that	0
the	0

together	0
will	0
have	0
an	0
ending	0

that	0
is	0

So	0
the	0

have	0
an	0

Now	0

the	0

ends	0

Another	0
reason	0
a	0

that	0

Hello	0
there. 	0
You	0
ask	0
about	0

shaky	0

in	0
to	0
your	0
therapy	0

want	0
to	0
know	0
if	0
its	0
normal	3
... 	0
I	0
realize	0
there	0
a	0
few	0
ways	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
this. 	0
I	0
presume	0
you	0
weren't anticipating	0
feeling	0
this	0
way;	0

probably	0
hoped	0
to	0
feel	0
the	0
opposite.. 	0
Well	1
my	0
initial	0
response	0
is	0
yes	1
sure	1
it	0
can	0
be	0
within	0
reason	0
to	0
feel	0
this	0
way. 	0
Have	0
you	0
been	0
in	0
therapy	0
before	3
Is	0
this	0
somewhat	0
new	3
That	0
could	0
be	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
reason	2
But	0
either	0
way;	0
new	0

not	1
I	0
think	0
when	0
are	0
entering	0
into	0
a	0
meeting	0
that	0
holds	0
potential	0
evaluation	0
of	0
deep	0
things	0
about	0
you	0

your	0
heart	0
and	0
soul	1
it	0
can	0
cause	0
anyone	0
to	0
tremble	2
The	0
soul	0
can	0
be	0
anticipating	0
some	0
things	0
could	0
be	0
shaken	0
up	0
here	1
and	0
it	0
can	0
feel	0
scary	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
these	0
things	0
and	0
then	0
change. 	0
Looking	0
deep	0
at	0
our	0
life	0
can	0
feel	0
daunting	0
and	0
scary;	0
so	0
your	0
response	0
just	0
might	0
be	0
regards	0
to	0
potential	0
growth	0
trying	0
to	0
happen.  	0
OR	1
is	0
there	0
something	0
about	0
the	0
therapist	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
confident	0
about? 	0
This	0
too	0
might	0
be	0
in	0
play	0
as	0
a	0
reason	0
for	0
your	0
feelings... 	0
Maybe	0
you	0
lack	0
confidence	0

that	0

? 	0
Have	0
you	0

what	0
are	0

Hi,When	0

to	0

look	0
at	0
how	0
we	0
make	0
our	0
decisions	2
Usually	0
we	0
are	0
getting	0
something	0
good	0
out	0
of	0
these	0

The	0

I	0

that	0

isn't	0
to	0
'find'	0
ourselves	2
We're	0
already	0
100%	0
"there."	0
What	0
we	0
do	0
have	0
to	0
do	0
is	0
become	0
more	0
mindful	0
of	0
the	0
times	0
when	0
we	0
feel	0
the	0
most	0
alive	1
most	0
happy	1
most	0
creative	1
and	0
most	0
fully	0
engaged	0
with	0

It	0
is	0
in	0
those	0
moments	0

no	0

tried	0
to	0
talk	0
me	0
out	0
of	0
them	2
All	0
I	0
needed	0
to	0
do	0
was	0
notice	0
when	0
my	0
heart	0
opened	0
and	0
I	0
felt	0
the	0
most	0
alive--not	0
because	0
I	0
was	0
afraid	0
or	0
addicted	1
but	0
because	0
in	0
those	0
moments	1
I	0
was	0
in	0
contact	0
with	0
my	0
highest	0
self. On	0
the	0
flip	0
side	1
I	0
needed	0
to	0
recognize	0
the	0
people	0
and	0
activities	0
that	0
consistently	0
brought	0
out	0
the	0
worst	0
in	0
me--the	0
ones	0
that	0
made	0
me	0
feel	0
controlled	1
constricted	1
dishonest	1
resentful	1
or	0
afraid--and	0
be	0
honest	0
about	0
them. Mindfulness	0
of	0
"what	0
already	0
is"	0
is	0
the	0
key	0
to	0
finding	0
yourself	2
Align	0
yourself	0
with	0
the	0
people	0
and	0
activities	0
that	0
matter	0
most	0
to	0
you	2
Don't	0
let	0
old	0
habits	1

define	0
you	2
Just	0
stumble	0
your	0

as	0
best	0
you	0
can	1
with	0
greater	0
self-awareness	0

by	0
affirmative	0
action.	2
Unfortunately	0
you	0
can't	0
directly	0
change	0
another	0
person's	0
behavior	2
However	1
you	0
can	0
give	0
him	0
feedback	0
on	0
how	0
his	0
not	0
listening	0
impacts	0
you	2
The	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
provide	0
feedback	0
is	0
in	0
3	0
parts	2
The	0
first	0
part	0
is	0
telling	0
him	0
the	0
emotion	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	0
when	0
he	0
doesn't	0
listen	1
such	0
as	0
hurt	1
sad	1
and	0
unloved	2
I	0
would	0
stay	0
away	0
from	0
feelings	0
such	0
as	0
frustrated	1
angry	0
and	0
irritated	0
and	0
use	0
a	0
more	0
vulnerable	0
emotion	2
The	0
second	0
part	0
is	0
what	0
he	0
does	0
specifically	0
to	0
make	0
you	0
feel	0
that	0
way	1
be	0
specific!	0
Example:	0
when	0
I	0
get	0
home	0
and	0
tell	0
you	0
about	0
my	0
day	0
and	0
you	0
don't	0
look	0
away	0
from	0
the	0
tv	2
Be	0
objective	0
as	0
possible	0
when	0
you	0
describe	0
his	0
behavior	2
And	0
the	0
last	0
part	0
is	0
the	0
most	0
important	1
tell	0
him	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
him	0
to	0
do	1
and	0
again	0
be	0
specific!	0
Example:	0
I	0
would	0
rather	0
you	0
turn	0
off	0
the	0
tv	1
give	0
me	0
eye	0
contact	0
and	0
reassure	0
me	0
about	0
my	0
day	2
Here	0
is	0
an	0
example	0
with	0
all	0
3	0
parts	0
together:	0
I	0
feel	0
hurt	0
when	0
you	0
don't	0
say	0
anything	0
to	0
me	0
when	0
I	0
tell	0
you	0
about	0
my	0
fight	0
with	0
my	0
friend	1
I	0
want	0
you	0
to	0
hug	0
me	0
and	0
tell	0
me	0
you	0
understand	0
how	0
I	0
feel	2

that	0

the	0

often	0

A	0

Hello	2

this	0
important	0
question	0
-	0
"is	0
it	0

for	0
us	0
to	0
get	0
past	0
the	0
cheating	1
or	0
should	0
I	0
just	0
move	0
on?" Deciding	0
to	0
stay	0
or	0
leave	0
is	0
such	0
a	0
personal	0
decision	1
one	0
that	0
only	0
you	0
can	0
make.When	0
an	0
affair	0
is	0
disclosed	0
or	0
found	0
out	1
it	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
traumatic	0
impact	0
on	0
the	0
betrayed	0
partner	2
The	0
betrayed	0

by	0
intrusive	0
thoughts	0
-	0
Wanting	0
answers	0
to	0
specific	0
questions	0
-	0
Wanting	0
details	2
And	0
the	0
partner	0
that	0
had	0
the	0
affair	0
might	0
be	0
feeling	0
overwhelm	0
around	0
"Will	0
their	0
partner	0
ever	0
forgive	0
them?"	0
"Will	0
they	0
trust	0
them	0
again?"	0
"How	0
long	0
will	0
it	0
take	0
to	0
regain	0
their	0
trust	0
again?" While	0
it	0
is	0
possible	0
for	0
couples	0
to	0
get	0
past	0
the	0
cheating	1
it	0
does	0
take	0
a	0
commitment	0
from	0
each	0
partner	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
work	0
needed	2
Because	0
of	0
the	0
complexities	0
cheating	0
has	0
on	0
the	0
bond	0
couples	0
have	0
with	0
each	0
other	1
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
seeing	0
a	0
couple	0
therapist	0
that	0
specializes	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
the	0
issue	0
of	0
infidelity	2
When	0
infidelity	0
happens	1
there	0
are	0
usually	0
a	0
number	0
of	0
secrets	0
that	0
accompany	0
it	1

this	0
can	0
be	0
incredibly	0
difficult	0
for	0

work	0
through	0
on	0
their	0
own.  	0
Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
serious	0
time	2
I	0
don't	0
mean	0
to	0
frighten	0
you	1
but	0
you	0
are	0
right	0
to	0
be	0
concerned	2
The	0
time	0
right	0
after	0
people	0
leave	0
the	0
hospital	0
after	0
receiving	0
psychiatric	0
services	0
is	0
a	0
time	0
of	0
high	0
risk	0
for	0
suicide	2
It	0
is	0
very	0
important	1
after	0
hospitalization, to	0
get follow-up	0
care	0
with	0
a	0
professional	0
as	0
soon	0
as	0
possible	2
If	0
your	0
husband	0
has	0
an	0
established	0
therapist	1
this	0
is	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
call	2
It	0
is	0
also	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
to	0
alert	0
your	0
support	0
system	0
of	0
friends	1
family	1
clergy	0
or	0
others	0
to	0
let	0
them	0
know	0
he	0
is	0
still	0
struggling	2
This	0
is	0
good	0
support	0
for	0
him	0
AND	0
you.It	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
means	0
and	0
opportunity	0
to	0
make	0
another	0
attempt	2
Means	0
really	0
do	0
matter. 	0
So	1
if	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
firearm	0
in	0
the	0
home	1
it	0
is	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
remove	0
it	2
You	0
can't	0
remove	0
all	0
things	0
that	0
a	0
person	0
may	0
hurt	0
themselves	0
with	1
but	0
some	0
things	0
are	0
more	0
lethal	0
than	0
others	2
Firearms	0
are	0
very	0
lethal	2
I	0
am	0
not	0
sure	0
what	0
means	0
he	0
used	0
last	0
time	1
but	0
try	0
to	0
reduce	0
the	0
opportunity	0
for	0
him	0
to	0
access	0
it	0
again	2
This	0
is	0
where	0
your	0
support	0
system	0
can	0
help	0
out	2
People	0
can	0
take	0
turns	0
hanging	0
out	0
with	0
him	0
until	0
you	0
are	0
sure	0
the	0
crisis	0
is	0
over.If	0
you	0
believe	0
that	0
an	0
attempt	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
occur	1
talk	0
to	0
your	0
husband	0
about	0
going	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
hospital	2
If	0
he	0
refuses	1
you	0
will	0
want	0
to	0
find	0
out	0
what	0
your	0
options	0
are	0
to	0
have	0
him	0
go	0
even	0
if	0
he	0
doesn't	0
want	0
to	2
I	0
know	0
the	0
thought	0
of	0
that	0
really	0
hurts	1
but	0
it	0
can	0
save	0
his	0
life	2
Calling	0
9-1-1	0
is	0
always a good	0
option	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
sure	2
Usually	0
a	0
suicide	0
crisis	1
meaning	0
they	0
want	0
to	0
harm	0
themselves	0
right	0
now	1

a	0

Sometimes	0

they	0

indicating	1
that	0

with	1
what's	0

What	0
I'd	0

I	0
would	0

that	0
the	0

my	0

a	0

could	0
help	0
you	0

where	0

up	0
whatever	0

up	0
for	0
them	0
in	0
the	0

it's	0

to	0
the	0

the	0

three	0

you	0

I	0

if	0
you	0

I	0
would	0
imagine	0
that	0

you	0
literally	0
were	0
doing	0
nothing	0

crying	0
every	0

For	0
one	0
thing	1
bills	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
paid.There	0
are	0
typically	0
five	0
stages	0
of	0
grief	0

they	0
can	0
come	0
in	0
any	0
order	2
You	0
can	0
go	0
back	0
to	0
another	0
stage	0
that	0
you	0
previously	0
experienced	2
Denial	1
anger	1
bargaining	1
depression	1
and	0
acceptance	0
are	0
the	0
stages. At	0
first	1
people	0
are	0
usually	0
in	0

the	0
fact	0
that	0
they	0
lose	0
someone	0

are	0
losing	0
someone	2
This	0
may	0
mean	0
that	0
you	0
deny	0
they	0
are	0
ill	0

deny	0
that	0
they	0
have	0
actually	0
died.Then	0
comes	0
bargaining	1
in	0
which	0
you	0
may	0
beg	0
God	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
only	0
have	0
this	0
person	0
back	0
then	0
you	0
will	0
do	0
whatever. Depression	0
is	0
when	0
the	0
reality	0
has	0
settled	0
in	0
and	0
when	0
we	0
cry	0

really	0

the	0
loss	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
stuck	0
in	0
this	0
phase.Finally	1
acceptance	0
is	0
when	0
we	0

that	0
it	0

and	0
we	0
pick	0
up	0
the	0
pieces	0
of	0
our	0

on.When	0

you	0

out	0

what	0

Since	0

so	0
important	0
to	0
us	0
we	0
fear	0
not	0
having	0
them	0
and	0
being	0
single	2
It	0
is	0
similar	0
to	0
fearing	0
that	0
we	0
won't	0
ever	0
get	0
a	0
good	0
job	0
when	0
we	0
have	0

out	0

healthy	0
when	0
we	0

We	0
fear	0
these	0

not	0
because	0
these	0

just	0
doesn't	0

Here	0
goes:Step	0
One:	0
Say	0
what	0
you	0

the	0
damage	0

Two:	0

What	0
makes	0

is	0
that	0
his	0
actions	0
(hugs	0

may	0

allowing	0

Some	0
ways	0
in	0
which	0
we	0

get	0
over	0

are	0
when	0
we	0
fall	0
in	0

when	0
we	0
suddenly	0
see	0
the	0
person	0

a	0
more	0
negative	0
or	0
unattractive	0
light	2
If	0
you	0
truly	0
want	0
to	0
force	0
yourself	0
to	0
get	0
over	0
him	1
cutting	0
contact or	0
setting	0
strict	0
boundaries	0
may	0
be	0
necessary	2
If	0
you	0
don't	0
see	0
him	1
over	0
time	0
you	0
can	0
begin	0
to	0
forget	0
about	0
him	2
If	0
you	0
set	0
boundaries	0
by	0
discontinuing	0
to	0
allow	0
the	0
hugs	0
and	0
touches	1
you	0
will	0
not	0
feel	0
mislead	0
or have	0
the	0
idea	0
in	0
your	0
mind	0
that	0
he	0
is	0
being	0

Hi	0
Louisiana,It's	0
normal	0
when	0

the	0
past	0
for	0
fear	0

to	0
come	0
up	0
from	0
time	0
to	0
time	2
His	0
reactions	0
may	0
not	0
mean	0
that	0
he	0
doesn't	0
trust	0
you	1
but	0
rather	0
that	0
he	0
gets	0
scared	0
that	0
he's	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
hurt	0
again. You're	0
a	0
bit	0
vague	0
about	0
the	0
past	2
You	0
don't	0
say	0
whether	0
you	0
cheated	0
or	0
not	2
If	0
you	0
did	1
then	0
you	0
might	0
try	0
taking	0
an	0
approach	0
where	0
you	0
a)	0
take	0
responsibility	0
for	0
your	0

b)	0
show	0
an	0
understanding	0

d)	0
reassure	0
him	0
when	0
he	0
says	0
he's	0
scared	0
or	0
feeling	0
insecure	2
I'm	0
suggesting	0
that	0
part	0
of	0
healing	0
is	0
you	0
having	0
tolerance	0
of	0
his	0
emotions	0
and	0
demonstrating	0
that	0
you're	0
so	0
confident	0
you	0
can	0
be	0
faithful	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
handle	0
his	0
moments	0
of	0
fear	2
This	0
is	0
what	0
he	0
and	0
the	0
marriage	0
need	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
heal	0
from	0
the	0
attachment	0
injury.Part	0
of	0
the	0
issue	0
might	0
be	0
that	0
when	0
he	0
brings	0
it	0
up	1
he's	0
coming	0
across	0
as	0
angry	1
accusing	0
or	0
suspicious	1
rather	0
than	0
scared	0

insecure	2
This	0
often	0
happens	2
A	0
therapist	0
can	0
help	0
both	0
of	0
you	0
understand	0
that	0
fear	0
is	0
behind	0
the	0
anger	1
and	0
it	0
works	0
best	0
if	0
he	0
shows	0
you	0
his	0

the	0
anger	0
(which	0

then	0
you	0
can	0
more	0
easily	0
recognise	0
the	0
cue	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
reassure	0
him. As	0
much	0
as	0
you	0

about	0

Hello.It	0
sounds	0

your	0

because	0
you	0
have	0
noticed	0

change	0
in	0
her	0
behavior	0
 	0
It's	0
really	0
a	0
great	0
first	0
step	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
reaching	0
out	0
to	0
get	0
some	0
ideas	0
about	0
what	0
might	0
be	0
going	0
on	0
 You	0
are	0
clearly	0
an	0
observant	0
and	0
hands	0
on	0
 mom	0
who	0
wants	0
to	0
be	0
sure	0
that	0
her	0
daughter	0
is	0
ok.This	0
is	0
a	0
tough	0
question	0
to	0
answer	0
without	0
more	0
information	0
 With	0
that	0
said	0
I	0
have	0
found	0
that	0
"under	0
stress	0
people	0
regress."	0
 In	0
other	0
words	0
many	0
people	0
children	0
and	0
adults	0
alike	0
often	0
regress	0
and	0
behave	0
differently	0
-	0
as	0
if	0
they	0
were	0
younger	0
than	0
their	0
actual	0
age	0
-	0
when	0
under	0
stress	0
 	0
Therefore	0
my	0
first	0
question	0
would	0
be	0
:	0
has	0
anything	0
been	0
happening	0
recently	0
that	0
is	0
causing	0
your	0
daughter	0
stress	0
 This	0
could	0
be	0
anything	0
from	0
conflict	0
at	0
home	0
recent	0
changes	0
such	0
as	0
moving	0
divorce	0
a	0
loss	0
of	0
some	0
kind	0
switching	0
schools	0
or	0
losing	0
a	0
friend	0
or	0

 	0
Additionally	0
sometimes	0
if	0
children	0
are	0
feeling	0
bullied	0
or	0
left	0
out	0
by	0
same	0
age	0
peers	0
they	0
may	0
gravitate	0
toward	0
younger	0
playmates	0
as	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
boost	0
their	0
social	0
confidence	0
 	0
 I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
what	0
stressors	0

changes	0
may	0
have	0

have	0
noticed	0

in	0

a	0
conversation	0
with	0
your	0

in	0

Hi	0
Attica,This	0
is	0
a	0
question	0
I	0
think	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
deal	0
with...they	0
feel	0
confusion	0
about	0
why	0
they	0
can't	0
forget	0
about	0
or	0
get	0
over	0
(or	0
stop	0
connecting	0
with)	0
someone	0
who	0
they	0
absolutely	0
know	0
isn't	0
good	0
for	0
them. In	0
your	0
case	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
that	0
he	0
keeps	0
trying	0
to	0
get	0
back	0
in	0
touch	0
with	0
you	2
For	0
some	0
people	1
honestly	1
it's	0
a	0
game..	2
to	0
see	0
how	0
much	0
power	0
they	0
have	0
over	0
you	0
or	0
it's	0
their	0
need	0
to	0
control	0
you	2
If	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
contact	0
from	0
this	0
person	1
it's	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
give	0
him	0
clear	0
messages	0
about	0
boundaries	0
("Don't	0
contact	0
me	0
again")	1
and	0
then	0
ignore	0
all	0
of	0
their	0
communications	2
Any	0
interactions	0
or	0
responses	0
from	0
you	0
at	0
all	0
will	0
feed	0
their	0
behaviour	2
Remind	0
yourself	0
why	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
with	0
them	2
I	0
hear	0
you	0
doing	0
that	0
already	0
when	0
you	0
say	0
"he	0
has	0
nothing	0
to	0
offer	0
me"	2
That's	0
great	0
self-talk.But	0
let's	0
get	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
question	0
of	0
why	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
hard	0
time	0
letting	0
go	0
of	0
people	0
like	0
this	2
Sometimes	0
it's	0
because	0
we	0
still	0
hope	0
they	0
will	0
change	2
Maybe	0
we	0
remember	0
who	0
they	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
or	0
how	0
they	0
used	0
to	0
treat	0
us	1
and	0
we	0
think	0
it	0
can	0
go	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
felt	0
in	0
those	0
"good	0
old	0
days"	2
The	0
problem	0
there	0
is	0
that	1
over	0
the	0
first	0
few	0
years	1
as	0
intimacy	0
grows	1
people	0
tend	0
to	0
show	0
more	0
of	0
who	0
they	0
are	1
not	0
less	2
So	0
what	0
they're	0
eventually	0
showing	0
you	0
is	0
who	0
they	0
are	0
and	0
what	0
they're	0
capable	0
of	2
People	0
do	0
change	0
and	0
grow	1
but	0
it	0
won't	0
happen	0
at	0
your	0
pace	2
Accept	0
that	0
person	0
for	0
who	0
they	0
are	0
and	0
stop	0
expecting	0
them	0
to	0
change. Another	0
reason	0
we	0
can't	0
let	0
go	0
is	0
because	0
we	0
picture	0
our	0
ex	0
with	0
someone	0
new	0
in	0
the	0
future	0
and	0
we	0
wonder	0
if	0
they	0
will	0
be	0
a	0
better	0
person	0
for	0
the	0
next	0
partner	0
in	0
their	0
life	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
normal..	2
but	0
not	0
a	0
healthy..	2
thought	2
It's	0
as	0
though	0
we	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
stay	1
maybe	0
apologize	1

our	0
hurts;	0
maybe	0
make	0
up	0

You	0
deserve	0
that	0
healing	1
you	0
deserve	0
better	0
than	0
you	0
got	1
you	0
deserve	0
apologies	1
but	0
to	0
expect	0
that	0
from	0
the	0
person	0
who	0
hurt	0
you	0
and	0
hasn't	0
demonstrated	0
that	0
compassion	0
as	0
yet	0
is	0
probably	0
foolhardy. It	0
is	0
my	0
belief	0
that	0
underlying	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
above	0
scenarios	0
is	0
the	0
deep	0
belief	0
that	0
we	0
must	0
somehow	0
be	0
responsible	0
for	0
the	0
hurts	0
our	0
exes	0
have	0
caused	2
If	0
you	0
blame	0
yourself	0
in	0
any	0
way	0
for	0
someone's	0
poor	0
treatment	0
of	0
you	1

will	0
be	0

around	0
trying	0
to	0
do	0

that	0
they	0
can	0
treat	0
you	0
better	2
It	0
will	0
be	0
impossible	0
to	0
let	0
go	1
because	0
you	0
blame	0
yourself	0
for	0
their	0

a	0
line	2
Their	0
behaviours	0
are	0
about	0
them	1

the	0
only	0
solution	0
is	0
to	0

Hi	2
 This	0
is	0
an	0
excellent	0
question	0

 	0
I	0
think	0
that	0
the	0
answer	0
probably	0
varies	0
depending	0
upon	0
the	0
particular	0
therapist	0
 In	0
my	0
work	0
with	0
people	0
once	0
we	0
have	0
met	0
and	0
I	0
have	0
gotten	0
an	0
idea	0
of	0
the	0
person'a	0
concerns	0
and	0
the	0
issues	0
they	0
want	0
help	0
with	0
I	0
spend	0
the	0
next	0
few	0
sessions	0
gathering	0
as	0
much	0
history	0
and	0
as	0

information	0
about	0
the	0
client's	0

in	0
order	0
to	0
formulate	0
some	0
ideas	0
about	0
what	0
may	0
be	0
causing	0

 I	0
would	0

with	0
the	0

on	0

That	0

tough	0
situation	0

are	0
experiencing	0
right	0
now	2
The	0
first	0
thing	0
to	0
under	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can’t	0
change	0
who	0
your	0
parents	0
are	0
and	0
cannot	0
change	0
their	0
behavior	2
The	0
thing	0
to	0
keep	0
in	0
mind	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
control	0
your	0
responses	0
and	0
actions	2
 You	0
may	0
need	0
to	0

the	0
next	0
few	0
months	0

years	0
and	0
the	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
do	0
this	0
is	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
plan	2
The	0
second	0
thing	0
is	0
to	0
keep	0
in	0
mind	0
that	0
their	0
controlling	0
behavior	0
is	0
most	0
likely	0
not	0
about	0
based	0
your	0
behavior	2
Controlling	0
parents	0

However	0
this	0
is	0
not	0

to	0
me	0
based	0
on	0
his	0

age	0

Having	0
a	0

there	0

Here's	0
a	0
really	0
big	0
secret	0
(which	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
keep	0
in	0
mind	0
as	0
counseling	0
begins):	0
Counselors	0
are	0
often	0
as	0
nervous	0
(if	0
not	0
more)	0
to	0
meet	0
a	0
new	0
client	1
as	0
the	0
client	0
is	0
to	0
meet	0
their	0
new	0
counselor	2
It's	0
true	2
We	0
as	0
professionals	0
are	0
trying	0
to	0
put	0
our	0
best	0
foot	0
forward	0
to	0
impress	0
you	0
with	0
our	0
awesome	0
counseling	0
skills	2
While	0
simultaneously	0
hiding	0
all	0
the	0
troubling	0
unwanted	0
issues	0
that	0
we	0
ourselves	0
have	0
in	0

the	0
client	0
sitting	0
in	0

of	0
us	2
What	0
makes	0
it	0
even	0
more	0
challenging	1
is	0
that	0
counselors	0
are	0
often	0
put	0
on	0
a	0
giant	0
pedestal	0
of	0
perfection	0
by	0
clients	0
(all	0
while	0
we	0
as	0

tend	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
it	0

we're	0
standing	0
on	0
a	0

us	0
when	0

from	0
the	0

the	0

Counselors	0
and	0
clients	0
are	0
both	0
human	1

we	0
both	0
make	0
mistakes	2
Coming	0
from	0
that	0
place	0
of	0
understanding	1
might	0
bring	0
a	0
sense	0
of	0
ease	0
to	0
both	0
the	0
client	0
and	0
the	0
therapist	0
as	0
they	0
seek	0
to	0
work	0
together. Part	0
of	0
this	0
perception	0
of	0
perfection	0
held	0
by	0
clients	0
toward	0
counselors	1
is	0
that	0
the	0
skills	0
of	0

they	0
have	0
all	0
the	0
answers	2
We	0
honestly	0

not	1
plain	0

simple	2
Counselors	0
come	0
from	0
life	0
experiences	0
(where	0
they	0
might	0
be	0
farther	0
down	0
on	0
life's	0
road	0
than	0
you);	0
they	0
hold	0
completion	0
of	0
various	0
forms	0
of	0
training;	0
and	0
have	0
advanced	0
education	2
Yet	0
we	0
are	0
in	0
the	0
end	1
imperfect	0
beings	0
struggling	0

This	0

door	0
with	0
the	0
hope	0
that	0
we	0
will	0
receive	0
that	0
same	0
compassion	0
in	0

Very	0
often	1
we	0
can	0
find	0
ourselves	0
reflected	0
in	0
our	0

lives	0
with	0
their	0

the	0

for	0

you	0
bring	0
up	0

In	0

it	0

to	0
say	0
"I'm	0

because	0
it	0

I	0

that	0

entirely	0
sure	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
be	0
struggling	0
in	0
this	0
area	1
an	0
initial	0
question	0
I	0
have	0
is	0
do	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
sexually	0
active	0
at	0
this	0
time	0
or	0
is	0
this	0
something	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
pressured	0
into	0
doing.	3
 If	0
you	0
feel	0
pressured	0
into	0
being	0
sexually	0
active	0
by	0
your	0
friends	0
or	0
boyfriend	0
it	0
is	0
understandable	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
it	0
to	0
be	0
over	2
 I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
ask	0
your	0
boyfriend	0
to	0
be	0
patient	0
with	0
you	0
at	0
this	0
time	0
 until	0
you	0
figure	0
out	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
on	2
 I	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
then	0
think	0
very	0
deeply	0
about	0
what	0
your	0
reservations	1
if	0
any	1
 about	0
being	0
sexually	0
active	2
 Do	0
you	0
fear	0
pregnancy	3
 Are	0
there	0
problems	0
in	0
the	0
relationship	3
 Are	0
you	0
afraid	0
of	0
the	0
emotional	0
intimacy? Another	0
question	0
that	0
comes	0
to	0
mind	0
is	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
you	0
have	0
any	0
history	0
of	0
sexual	0
activity	0
that	0
you	0
did	0
not	0
consent	0
to	0
that	0
might	0
be	0
getting	0
in	0
the	0
way	2
 	0
When	0
these	0
types	0
of	0
traumatic	0
events	0
occur	1
 people	0
can	0
essentially	0
become	0
triggered	0
negatively	0
by	0
anything	0
that	0
reminds	0
them	0
of	0
past	0
trauma	2
 Such	0
events	0
can	0
cause	0
an	0
aversion	0
to	0
sex	0
even	0
if	0
there	0
is	0
now	0
a	0
loving	0
relationship	0
whom	0
one	0
wants	0
to	0
be	0
sexually	0
active	0
with	2
 If	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
case	0
I	0
strongly	0
recommend	0
individual	0
therapy	0
to	0
begin	0
working	0
through	0
some	0
of	0
these	0
issues. A	0
final	0
area	0
that	0
you	0
might	0
explore	0
would	0
be	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	0
pain	0
with	0
penetration	2
 If	0
so	1
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
that	0
you	0
schedule	0
an	0
appointment	0
with	0
a	0
gynecologist	0
to	0
rule	0
out	0
any	0
type	0
of	0
medical	0
issues	0
that	0
might	0
be	0
causing	0
these	0
problems	2
 Although	0
pain	0
can	0
also	0
be	0
associated	0
with	0
emotional	0
issues	1
it	0
is	0
always	0
good	0
to	0
rule	0
out	0
possible	0
physical	0
causes	2
 I	0
hope	0
that	0
these	0
ideas	0
help	0

point	0
you	0
in	0
the	0
right	0
direction	2
 Take	0
care	2
Awareness	0
is	0
the	0
first	0
step. 	0
Now	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
snap	0
and	0
push	0
people	0
away	1
you	0
can	0
look	0
into	0
ways	0
to	0
control	0
your	0
anger. 	0
If	0
you	0
give	0
yourself	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
analyze	0
why	0
you	0
experience	0
anger	1
you	0
will	0
discover	0
that	0
there	0

underneath;	0
 shame	1

Deciding	0
to	0
end	0
a	0

is	0
a	0
big	0
question	0
that	0
deserves	0
your	0
full	0
care	0
and	0
attention. 	0
One	0
of	0
the	0
first	0
questions	0
you	0
may	0
ask	0
of	0
yourself	0
and	0
consider	0
for	0
your	0

is	0
whether	0
you	0
are	0
both	0

the	0

A	0

no	0

work	0
on	0

on	0

one	0
of	0
you	0
is	0
not	0
willing	0
or	0
able	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
this	0
then	0
the	0
relationship	0
can't	0
really	0
grow	0
or	0
get	0
better. 	0
Perhaps	0
spend	0
some	0
time	0
really	0
asking	0
yourself	0
if	0
you	0
this	0

the	0
person	0
you	0

All	0

also	0
ask	0
us	0
to	0
really	0
take	0
responsibility	0
for	0
what	0
we	0
contribute. 	0
This	0
should	0
be	0
done	0
in	0
a	0

where	0
you	0

to	0
do	0
this	0

Let's	0
just	0
start	0
with	0
being	0
real	2
Expressing	0
yourself	0
is	0
vulnerable	1
and	0
being	0
vulnerable	0
is	0
hard	2
It	0
takes	0
courage	0
and	0
work	0
to	0
be	0
vulnerable	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
shown	0
in	0
your	0
lifetime	0
that	0
being	0
vulnerable	0
(ie	1
expressing	0
yourself)	0
is	0
unsafe	2
My	0
assumption	0
would	0
be	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
criticized	1
or	0
ignored	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
expressed	0
yourself	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
it	0
has	0
taught	0
your	0
emotional	0
self	0
to	0
simply	0
not	0
do	0
it	0
again	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
normal	0
protective	0
mechanism	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
used	0
to	0
cope	0
with	0
past	0
feelings	0
of	0
hurt	2
It	0
will	0
take	0
time	0
and	0
work	0
to	0
engage	0
again	0
in	0
an	0
emotional	0
way.I	0
would	0
start	0
my	0
practicing	0
and	0
identifying	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
to	0
yourself	2
Check	0
in	0
with	0
yourself	0
multiple	0
times	0
a	0
day	0
to	0
gage	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
at	0
emotionally	2
After	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
grasp	0
on	0
this	1
start	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
emotional	0
conversations	0
with	0
others	2
Choose	0
others	0
that	0
feel	0
safe	0
to	0
you	1
a	0
good	0
friend	0
that	0
knows	0
you	0
well	1
or	0
a	0
sibling	0
or	0
family	0
member	2
Expressing	0
yourself	0
is	0
a	0
behavior	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
suppressed	0
out	0
of	0
protection	1
so	0
you	0
can	0
choose	0

the	0

This	0

You	0
grow	0

your	0

growing	0
need	0
for	0

and	0
independance	2
I'm	0
all	0
for	0
helping	0
you	0
find	0
new	0
ways	0
to	0
cope	0
and	0
interact	0
with	0
your	0
mom. Ultimately	1
you	0
only	0
have	0
control	0
over	0
yourself	1
so	0
that's	0
the	0
place	0
to	0
start	2
You	0
can	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0
Mom's	0
behaviours	0
don't	0
mean	0
that	0
she	0
doesn't	0
trust	0
you	0
or	0
love	0
you;	0
it's	0
just	0
that	0
she	0
has	0
habitual	0
ways	0
of	0
talking	0
to	0
you	0
that	0
seem	0
stuck	0
in	0
the	0
fourteen	0
year	0
old	0
range	2
If	0
you	0
can	0
see	0
her	0
responses	0
as	0
habits	1
rather	0
than	0
a	0
reflection	0
of	0
how	0
she	0
feels	0
about	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
can	0
keep	0
yourself	0
calm	2
The	0
more	0
calm	0
you	0
are	1
the	0
more	0
she	0
will	0
buy	0
into	0
it	0
when	0
you	0
invite	0
her	0
into	0
a	0
different	0
sort	0
of	0
relationship. Take	0
a	0
look	0
at	0
the	0
picture	0
from	0
her	0
perspective	2
She	0
may	0
feel	0
overwhelmed	0
with	0
finances	0
(are	0
you	0
in	0
college?)	1
and	0
feel	0
burdened	0
by	0
the	0

tasks	0
in	0
life	0
that	0
she	0
doesn't	0
know	0
how	0
to	0
recruit	0
help	0
for	2
I	0
bet	0
your	0
mom	0
spends	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
time	0
picking	0
up	0
after	0
you	1
cleaning	1
cooking	1
doing	0
laundry...all	0
those	0
thankless	0
mom	0
tasks	2
Take	0
a	0
look	0
at	0
how	0
she	0
talks	0
to	0
you..	2
is	0
she	0
nagging	0
about	0
chores	3
Can	0
you	0
see	0
that	0
underneath	0
the	0
nagging	0
there's	0
a	0
pretty	0
overwhelmed	0
and	0
powerless	0
person	0
who	0
needs	0
assistance	3
 Okay	1
so	0
my	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
both	0
have	0
a	0
legitimate	0
beef	2
She	0
wants	0
help	2
You	0
want	0
respect	2
Let's	0
talk	0
about	0
how	0
you	0
get	0
both.I	0
propose	0
that	0
you	0
sit	0
down	0
with	0
mom	0
and	0
negotiate	0
out	0
a	0
different	0
sort	0
of	0
dynamic	2
"Mom...I	0
see	0
us	0
as	0
stuck	0
in	0
how	0
we	0

when	0
I	0
was	0
fourteen	2
Can	0
we	0
do	0
this	0
differently	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
that	0
we	0
both	0
get	0
what	0
we	0
want?"	0
Sell	0
it	0
as	0
"win-win"	2
Then	0
you	0
write	0
down	0
some	0
things	0
that	0
end	0
up	0
forming	0
a	0
contract. The	0
first	0
part	0
is	0
stuff	0
that's	0
your	0
business	0
and	0
your	0
business	0
alone:	0
things	0
you	0
want	0
your	0

your	0
room	1
your	0
school	1
your	0
job	1
your	0
personal	0
relationships	0
and	0
hygiene...	2
Mom's	0

are	0

it's	0
a	0
health	0
hazard	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
"Mom	0
says	0
nothing	0
about"	0
list. The	0
second	0
part	0
is	0
about	0
what	0
Mom	0
needs	0
from	0
you	2
What	0
are	0
her	0
expectations	0
about	0
your	0
role	0
in	0

put	0
in	0
your	0

off	0
of	0
Mom	3

these	0

be	0
enforced	3
What	0
will	0
happen	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
follow	0
through	3
Write	0
it	0
all	0
down	0
so	0
it's	0
really	0
clear	2
It	0
has	0
to	0
all	0
be	0
mutually	0
agreed	0
upon.The	0
third	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
conversation	0
is	0
about	0
how	0
she	0
talks	0
to	0
you	1
and	0
how	0
you	0
talk	0
to	0
her	2
You	0
can	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
you	0

to	0
be	0
told	0
what	0

when	0
to	0

it;	0
that	0

when	0
you're	0
20	0

Listen	0
to	0
what	0
she	0
wants	0
too	2
Beyond	0
the	0
contract	0
you've	0
just	0
written	0
up	1
anything	0
else	0
you	0

from	0
each	0

whether	0

when	0
you	0
do	0
it	0

at	0

discretion	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
if	0

to	0
you	0
with	0

you'd	0
be	0
more	0

out	2
AND	1
I	0
think	0
if	0
you	0

a	0

she	0

nag	0
at	0
you	0
less	2
Go	0
for	0
the	0
win-win. I	0

If	0
not	1
I	0
would	0
advise	0
that	0
you	0
do	0
so	0
sooner	0

later	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
learn	0
what	0
is	0
causing	0
you	0

and	0
causing	0
difficulty	0
with	0
breaking	0
the	0

It	0
is	0
also	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
medical	0
evaluation	0
from	0
your	0

what	0

you	0

goals	0
for	0

them	0
down	0
each	0
morning	0

the	0

Achieving	0
your	0
goals	0
every	0

will	0
give	0
you	0
a	0
sense	0
of	0

can	0

what	0
ideas you	0
have	0
to	0

better	2
Sometimes	0
having these	0
ideas written	0
down	0
make	0
it	0
more	0
real	0
and	0
tangible. Know	0
that	0
depression is most	0
often	0
curable	0
but	0
takes	0
work	0
and	0
a	0
desire	0
to	0
change	0
(which	0
you	0

Once	0
you	0
start	0
feeling	0
better	0
about	0
yourself	0
and	0
your	0
life	1
your	0
grades	0
should	0
naturally	0

Hi	1

something	1

I	0

that	2
You	0
might	0
feel	0
very	0
helpless	1
sad	1
and	0
disrespected	0
at	0
the	0

time	2
He's	0
changed. It's	0
unfair	0
for	0
him	0
to	0
blame	0
you	0
for	0
his	0
emotions	2
His	0
mood	0

he's	0

it. Are	0
you	0
respecting	0
yourself	0
here	0
by	0
drawing	0
appropriate	0
boundaries	3
You	0
can	0
let	0
him	0
know	0
when	0
you	0
feel	0

what's	0
not	0
okay	0
with	0
you.He	0
may	0
be	0
experiencing	0
depression	1
which	0
often	0
shows	0
up	0
as	0
irritability	0
in	0

It	0
could	0
be	0
that	0

he's	0

approach	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
could	0
go	0
with	0

Suicide	0

EXTREMELY	0
tough	0
to	0

that	0

C	0
I	0
wonder	0
if	0
both	0
you	0

have	0
a	0

about	0
what	0
you	0

from	0
one	0

now	2
That	0

necessarily	0

that	0
your	0

will	0
give	0
everything	0
that	0
you	0
ask	0
for	1

this	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
ways	0
that	0
he	0
can	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
what	0
would	0
help	0
you	0
through	0
this	0
and	0
you	0
can	0
learn	0
how	0
you	0
could	0
support	0
him	1
since	0
traditional	0
medical	0
treatment	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
he	0
wants.You	0
may	0
also	0
consider	0
using	0
some	0
open-ended	0
questions	0
(not	0

to	0
talk	0
about	0
what	0

about	0

about	0
your	0

that	0
you	0

one	0

would	0
also	0
see	0
if	0
he	0

this	0

a	0
few	0
of	0
your	0

Hi	0
there, Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
It's	0
absolutely	0
ok	0
to	0
feel	0
nervous	0
going	0
to	0
therapy	2
I	0
have	0
experienced	0
anxiety	0
going	0
to	0
see	0
my	0
own	0
therapist	2
There	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
few	0
reasons	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
this	0
way. First	1
it	0
is	0
always	0
unnerving	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
person	0
who	0
is	0
a	0
stranger	0
and	0
to	0
share	0
intimate	0
things	0
with	0
that	0
stranger	2
You	0
mentioned	0
it	0
has	0
only	0
been	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
sessions	2
Your	0
anxiety	0
might	0
subside	0
as	0
you	0
continue	0
to	0
see	0
your	0
therapist	0
and	0
grow	0
more	0
comfortable	0
with	0
him/her. Another	0
reason	0
why	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
particularly	0
nervous	0
is	0
perhaps	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
comfortable	0
sharing	0
things	2
As	0
children	1
we	0
might	0
have	0
bad	0
experiences	0
opening	0
up	0
to	0
others	2
Someone	0
might	0
bully	0
or	0
ridicule	0
us	1
and	0
that	0
experience	0
can	0
stay	0
with	0
us	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
making	0
it	0
extra	0
scary	0
to	0

intimate	0
feelings	0

way	0

Crying	0

a	0

release	0
those	0

emotions	0
and	0
to	0
cope	0
with	0
what	0
is	0

We	0
have	0
come	0
to	0
believe	0
that	0
crying	0
is	0
something	0
bad	0
at	0
times	0
and	0
so	0
have	0
conditioned	0
ourselves	0
to	0
avoid	0

out	0
in	0

In	0

you	0

be	0
aware	0
that	0
each	0
end	0
every	0
one	0
of	0
us	0
has	0
anxiety	0
at	0
some	0
point	2
That	0
certainly	0
seems	0
to	0
fit	0
what	0
you're	0
describing	0
here	1
but	0
that	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
you	0
have	0
an	0
anxiety	0
disorder	1
necessarily	2
That's	0
where	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
difference	2
Anyone	0
who	0
has	0
a	0
hard	0
time	0
with	0

feels	0
uncomfortable	0
in	0
large	0
crowds	1
for	0

is	0
experiencing	0
anxiety.It	0
sounds	0
like	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0

at	0
the	0

on	0
the	0

that	0
you	0

If	0
you	0
notice	0
your	0
anxiety	0
is	0
keeping	0
you	0
from	0
doing	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
need	0
or	0
want	0
to	0
do	1
it	0
may	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
talk	0
with	0
and	0
mental	0
health	0
professional.I	0
wonder	0
also	0
whether	0
your	0
appetite	0
and	0
sleeping	0
patterns	0
are	0
the	0
same	0
or	0
similar	0
to	0
how	0
they	0
were	0
before	0
you	0
experienced	0
this	0
anxiety	1
when	0
your	0
anxiety	0
started	1
and	0
whether	0
you	0
feel	0
more	0
comfortable	0
when	0
someone	0
you	0
trust	0
is	0
there	0
with	0
you.If	0
you	0
have	0
an	0
idea	0
of	0
times	0
or	0
situations	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
feel	0
anxious	1
consider	0
carrying	0
a	0
small	0
smooth	0
rock	0
or	0
another	0
object	0
that	0
makes	0
you	0
feel	0
calm	0
and	0
centered	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
can	0
keep	0
it	0
in	0
your	0
pocket	0
and	0
remember	0
specific	0
comfortable	0
times	0
while	0
you	0
have	0
it	0
in	0
your	0
hand	2
Hopefully	0
both	0
the	0
client	0
and	0
counselor	0
would	0
together	0
decide	0
when	0
to	0
terminate	0
counseling	0
sessions	2
It's	0
really	0
helpful	0
for	0
the	0
client	0
to	0
leave	0
counseling	0
with	0
a	0
solid	0
sense	0
of	0
what	0
he	0
or	0
she	0
has	0
accomplished	0
in	0
counseling	1
so	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
good	0
idea	0
to	0
spend	0
some	0
time	0
acknowledging	0
that	0
in	0
the	0
last	0
session	0
or	0
sessions	2
Sometimes	1
however	1
a	0
client	0
has	0
needs	0
beyond	0
the	0
scope	0
of	0
the	0
counselor's	0
expertise	2
That's	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
for	0
a	0
conversation	0
about	0
those	0
needs	0
and	0
ideas	0
of	0
 how	0
best	0
to	0
meet	0
them	1
whether	0
by	0
adding	0
in	0
care	0
with	0
an	0
additional	0
mental	0
health	0
professional	0
or	0
transferring	0
care	0
entirely	0
to	0
a	0
new	0
mental	0
health	0
provider	2
I	0
think	0
there	0
are	0
many	0
different	0
directions	0
we	0
could	0
go	0
as	0
far	0
as	0
answering	0
your	0
question	2
 I	0
think	0
the	0
first	0
and	0
most	0
important	0
question	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
ask	0
yourself	0
is	0
do	0
you	0
truly	0
believe	0
in	0
your	0
heart	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
forgive	0
him	0
and	0
trust	0
him	0
again	3
 Once	0
you	0
answer	0
that	0
question	0
honestly	0
then	0
you	0
can	0
move	0
in	0
one	0
of	0
two	0
directions	2
 First	1
if	0
you	0
truly	0
love	0
this	0
guy	0
and	0
see	0
yourself	0
being	0
with	0
him	0
long	0
term	0
and	0
for	0
the	0
"long	0
haul"	1
so	0
to	0
speak...and	0
you	0
genuinely	0
want	0
to	0
forgive	0
him	0
and	0
trust	0
him	0
again	1
that	0
is	0
completely	0
do-able	0
and	0
possible	0
if	0
you	0
both	0
put	0
in	0
the	0
work	2
 But	1
there's	0
a	0
greater	0
issue	0
here	0
that	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
addressed	2
 You	0
say	0
your	0
relationship	0
is	0
"good"	1
but	0
there's	0
been	0
a	0
sexual	0
disconnect	0
between	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you	0
and	0
that	0
usually	0
indicates	0
some	0
type	0
of	0
emotional	0
disconnect	0
is	0
at	0
the	0
core	2
 Would	0
you	0
agree	0
with	0
that	1
or	0
what	0
are	0
your	0
thoughts	3
 Were	0
you	0
giving	0
him	0
less	0
sexual	0
attention	0
than	0
you	0
normally	0
do	0
or	0
were	0
you	0
guys	0
never	0
on	0
the	0
same	0
page	0
about	0
sexual	0
needs	0
and	0
having	0
compatible	0
sex	0
drives	3
 If	0
you	0
are	0
more	0
of	0
an	0
emotional	0
person	0
than	0
he	0
is	1
you	0
may	0
have	0
been	0
less	0
interested	0
sexually	0
because	0
he	0
hasn't	0
been	0
meeting	0
your	0
emotional	0
needs	2
 For	0
instance	1
if	0
you	0
hadn't	0
been	0
feeling	0
loved	1
cared	0
about	1
validated	1
appreciated	1
cherished	1

special	0

him	0
than	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
felt	0
less	0
connected	0
physically	0
and	0
been	0
less	0
interested	2
 This	0
is	0
a	0
common	0
issue	0
with	0
couples	1
and	0
can	0
easily	0
be	0
addressed	0
if	0
the	0
communication	0
in	0
your	0
relationship	0
is	0
strong	0
and	0
you	0
can	0
find	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
express	0
to	0
him	0
your	0
frustrations	2
 In	0
essence	1
many	0
women	0
tend	0
to	0
have	0
more	0
emotional	0
needs	0
than	0
men	1
this	0
is	0
the	0
way	0
we	0
are	0
hard-wired	1
and	0
there	0
are	0
exceptions	0
to	0
this	0
of	0
course	1
but	0
if	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
feeling	0
neglected	0
emotionally	0
than	0
your	0
lack	0
of	0
interest	0
in	0
sex	0
is	0
actually	0
completely	0
understandable	0
and	0
NORMAL!	0
 Until	0
he	0
understands	0
this	1
and	0
can	0
learn	0
to	0
tune	0
into	0
your	0
needs	0
emotionally	1
you	0
may	0
struggle	0
with	0
feeling	0
you	0
are	0
out	0
of	0
sync	0
emotionally	0
(and	0
sexually)	2
 This	0
leads	0
to	0
you	0
both	0
being	0
frustrated	1
but	0
if	0
all	0
this	0
is	0
ringing	0
true	0
to	0
you	1
he	0
seriously	0
probably	0
has	0
no	0
clue	0
what's	0
going	0
on	0
and	0
may	0
not	0
know	0
how	0
you're	0
feeling	2
 You	0

to	0

your	0
needs	0
to	0
him;	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
super	0
lost	0
with	0
how	0
to	0
do	0
that	1
there's	0
an	0
awesome	0
book	0

 It's	0
not	0

the	0
concepts	0
to	0
your	0

Invaluable	0
resource	0
for	0
relationships	0
and	0
truly	0
eye	0
opening;	0
really!!This	0
is	0
a	0
long	0
post	1
I'm	0
sorry!	0
 But	0
this	0
is	0
such	0
an	0
important	0
issue	0
that	0
is	0
very	0
common	0
and	0
many	0
people	0
feel	0
lost	0
about	0
how	0
to	0
handle	0
it	2
 So	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
second	0
direction	0
you	0
can	0
go....you	0
feel	0
very	0
betrayed	1
you	0
aren't	0
sure	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
ever	0
trust	0
him	0
again	0
and	0
you	0
see	0
yourself	0
perhaps	0
being	0
paranoid	0
forever	0
and	0
never	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
completely	0
get	0
over	0
this	2
 For	0
instance	1
if	0
he	0
says	0
he	0
is	0
working	0
late	1
or	0
if	0
he	0
doesn't	0
call	0
or	0
text	0
right	0
away	0
when	0
he	0
usually	0
does	1
you	0
may	0
immediately	0
jump	0
to	0
the	0
worst	0
case	0
scenario	0
that	0
he	0
is	0
cheating	0
again	2
 Of	0
course	1
it	0
may	0
not	0
be	0
true	1
he	0
may	0
have	0
legit	0
reasons	0
for	0
his	0
behaviors	1
but	0
the	0
point	0
is	0
if	0
you	0
are	0
going	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
paranoia-mode	0
OR	0
you	0
just	0
will	0
always	0
be	0
unsure	0
whether	0
he	0
loves	0
you	0
and	0
is	0
committed	0
to	0
you	0
and	0
only	0
you	1
then	0
the	0
trust	0
may	0
not	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
be	0
re-built	2
 You	0
need	0
to	0
think	0
long	0
and	0
hard	0
about	0
this	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
decide	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
capacity	0
to	0
forgive	0
him	0
and	0
rebuild	0
your	0
foundation	0
of	0
trust	0
and	0
honesty	1
then	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
let	0
him	0
know	0
very	0
explicitly	0
what	0
you	0
need	0
him	0
to	0
do	0
to	0
earn	0
that	0
trust	0
back	2
 You	0
can't	0
just	0
tell	0
him	0
vaguely	0
"I	0
need	0
to	0
trust	0
you	0
again";	0
if	0
he	0
wants	0
his	0
family	0
back	0
and	0
he's	0
willing	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
work	1
you	0
need	0
to	0
line	0
out	0
exactly	0
what	0
he	0
needs	0
to	0
do	0
and	0
he	0
needs	0
to	0
do	0
it	2
 But	1
be	0
prepared	0
that	0
he	0
might	0
throw	0
out	0
there	0
that	0
he	0
cheated	0
because	0
he	0
felt	0
you	0
weren't	0
attracted	0
to	0
him	0
anymore	0
(or	0
he	0
tries	0
to	0
put	0
the	0
blame	0
on	0
you	0
somehow	0
because	0
he	0
says	0
you	0
weren't	0
meeting	0
his	0
physical	0
needs)...if	0
he	0
throws	0
that	0
out	0
there	1
but	0
you	0
weren't	0
showing	0
him	0
the	0
affection	0
because	0
you	0
were	0
frustrated	0
emotionally	1
then	0
it	0
all	0
starts	0
with	0
you	0
communicating	0
that	0
to	0
him	2
 Get	0
that	0
book!In	0
conclusion	1
if	0
you	0
feel	0
in	0
your	0
heart	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
trust	0
him	0
again	0
and	0
you	0
will	0
always	0
wonder	0
if	0
he's	0
cheating	0
when	0
his	0
behavior	0
isn't	0
spot	0
on	1
you	0
will	0
be	0
a	0
nervous	0
wreck	0
and	0
perhaps	0
cutting	0
your	0
losses	0
now	0
would	0
spare	0
you	0
the	0
continued	0
heartache	2
 There	0
is	0
certainly	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
work	0
through	0
this	1
but	0
you	0
both	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
motivated	0
and	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
get	0
to	0
the	0
source	0
of	0
why	0
the	0
cheating	0
happened	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
place	2
 Rebuilding	0
trust	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
long	0
process	1
maybe	0
even	0
years	1
and	0
for	0
some	0
people	1
they	0
may	0
never	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
fully	0
trust	0
and	0
let	0
go	0
of	0
the	0
past	2
 I	0
truly	0
recommend	0
starting	0
with	0
the	0
book	1
and	0
then	0
going	0
from	0
there	2
 If	0
you	0
decide	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
stay	0
with	0
him	1
you	0
would	0
really	0
benefit	0
from	0
couples	0
counseling	1
as	0
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
a	0
professional	0
could	0
help	0
you	0
strengthen	0
your	0
communication	0
and	0
ability	0
to	0
trust	0
again	2
No	2
You	0
are	0
not	0
a	0

You	0
are	0
both	0
under	0
the	0

age	0
where	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
seen	0
so	2
Your	0
both	0
only	0
a	0

Those	0
kinds	0
of	0
thoughts	0
can	0
be	0
quite	0
difficult	0
to	0

if	0
they	0
are	0
your	0

(and	0

they	0

are	0

From	0
what	0
I've	0
learned	0
from	0
clients	0
I	0
work	0
with	1
often	0
these	0
thoughts	0
have	0
been	0
quite	0
useful	0
for	0
them	0
over	0
the	0
course	0
of	0
their	0
lives	1
that	0
through	0
criticizing	0
oneself	1
it	0
is	0
a	0
way	0
of	0
motivating	0
oneself	2
However	1
in	0
your	0
case	0
and	0
in	0
most	0
of	0
those	0
clients	1
it	0
has	0
caught	0
up	0
to	0
them	0
and	0
it's	0
almost	0
like	0
they	0
no	0
longer	0
need	0
the	0
motivation	0
(that	0
they	0
can	0
do	0
just	0
fine	0
motivating	0
themselves	0
by	0
themselves!)I	0
think	0
it's	0
important	0
to	0
see	0
these	0
thoughts	0
as	0
the	0
voice	0
of	0
the	0
"inner	0
critic."	0
That	0
inner	0
critic	0
was	0
there	0
for	0
a	0
long	0
time	1
again	1
because	0
"it"	0
(I	0
like	0
to	0
identify	0
it	0
as	0
a	0
thing	0
inside	0
of	0
you)	0
thought	0
that	0
you	0
needed	0
motivation	0
in	0
the	0
form	0
of	0
criticism	0
to	0
stay	0
on	0
task	0
with	0
your	0
life	2
But	0
now	0
that	0
that	0
kind	0
of	0
sentiment	0
is	0
no	0
longer	0
needed	0
by	0
you	1
it	0
might	0
be	0
time	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
different	0
kind	0
of	0
relationship	0
with	0
it	2
But	0
it	0
wants	0
to	0
be	0
heard	2
It	0
doesn't	0
want	0
to	0
silenced	0
(Or	0
"stopped"	0
in	0
your	0
words.)	0
So	0
instead	0
of	0
trying	0
to	0
ignore	0
it	1
perhaps	0
we	0
can	0
see	0
all	0
the	0
ways	0
you	0
are	0
worth	0
something	0
and	0
internalize	0
(take	0
in	1
let	0
those	0
ways	0

with	0

with	0
them	1

so	0
that	0
the	0

can	0

that	0
it	0
isn't	0
quite	0
correct	0
in	0
what	0
it	0

saying	2
In	0
essence	1
you	0
are	0
instead	0
sitting	0
with	0
the	0

instead	0
of	0

that	0
is	0
challenging	1
sometimes	0
seeing	0
someone	0
who	0

objective	1
such	0
as	0

can	0

They	0

above	0

here	2
 For	0
myself	1
I	0
review	0
policies	0
and	0
confidentiality	0
concerns	0
with	0
people	0
first	0
and	0
answer	0
any	0
questions	0
they	0
have. Then	0
I'll	0
let	0
them	0
know	0
I'll	0
be	0
writing	0
a	0
lot	0
in	0
this	0
session	0
and	0
I	0
have	0
an	0
assessment	0

that	0
I	0

I	0
want	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
conversation	0
and	0
I'll	0
ask	0
questions	0
as	0
we	0
go	2
 My	0
first	0
question	0
is	0
usually	1
"How	0
do	0
you	0
feel	0
I	0
can	0
best	0
help	0
you	0
today?"	0
 Some	0
people	0
are	0
very	0
at	0
ease	0
and	0
tell	0
me	0
many	0
details	2
 Others	0
are	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
reserved	0
and	0
I	0
have	0
to	0
demonstrate	0
more	0
curiosity	2
 Even	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
been	0
very	0
apprehensive	0
are	0
usually	0
feeling	0
very	0
relaxed	0
by	0
the	0
time	0
the	0
session	0
is	0
over	2
 Usually	1
when	0
we	0
get	0
close	0
to	0
end	0
of	0
session	0
time	1
I'll	0
summarize	0
what	0
I	0
think	0
are	0
the	0
biggest	0
concerns	0
from	0
what	0
I've	0
heard	0
and	0
confirm	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
the	0
person	0
wants	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
those	0
things	2
 I	0
also	0
try	0
to	0
give	0
an	0
exercise	0
targetting	0
my	0
biggest	0
concern	0
for	0
them	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
in	0
between	0
sessions	2
 For	0

a	0

method	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
very	0
anxious	2
 Counselors	0
are	0
just	0
humans	0
as	0
well	1
so	0
it	0
does	0
take	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
time	0
to	0
really	0
get	0
to	0
know	0
another	0
person	2
 I	0
always	0
tell	0
people	0
that	0
are	0
apprehensive	0
to	0
give	0
the	0
counselor	0
3	0
or	0
4	0
sessions	0
to	0
determine	0
if	0
they	0
really	0
connect	0
with	0
them	2
 I	0
hope	0
that	0
helps, Allison	0
The	0
answer	0
here	0
really	0
depends	0
upon	0
your	0
age	0
and	0
something	0
called	0
the	0
"age	0
of	0
consent"	0
in	0
the	0
state	0
where	0
you	0
live	2
In	0
Pennsylvania	1
anyone	0
over	0
the	0
age	0
of	0
14	0
can	0
provide	0
consent	0
for	0
their	0
own	0
treatment	2
As	0
for	0

purposes	1
try	0
talking	0
to	0
some	0

you	0
may	0
be	0

that	0
you	0

there	0
may	0

some	0

rates	0
at	0
some	0
agencies	0
because	0
of	0
the	0
situation	0
you're	0
in	2
Maybe	0
your	0

will	0

This	0

will	0

that	0
I'm	0
not	0
specifically	0
familiar	0
with	0
this	0
from	0
my	0
own	0
experience.My	0
best	0
educated	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
have	0
a	0
seizure	0
during	0
which	0
you	0
have	0
some	0
sort	0
of	0
symptoms	0
similar	0
to	0
a	0
hallucination	0
(which	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
psychotic	0
symptoms)	0
when	0
you	0

see	0
things	0
that	0

really	0
there.In	0
looking	0
briefly	0
online	1
I	0
was	0

to	0
find	0
some	0
information	0
here: http://www.epilepsy.com/information/professionals/about-epilepsy-seizures/psychiatric-and-behavioral-aspects/psychiatric-2It	0
sounds	0

a	0
symptom	0
in	0

If	0
it	0
is	0
the	0
other	0
way	0
around	1
I'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
that	0
would	0
work	2
It	0
is	0
common	0
with	0
some	0
types	0
of	0
seizures	0
to	0
have	0
an	0
altered	0
state	0
of	0
reality	0
during	0
or	0
shortly	0
after	0
the	0
seizure	1
so	0
that	0
could	0
also	0
be	0
related.I	0
would	0
suggest	0
you	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0
physician	0
about	0
this	0
directly	0
so	0
that	0
if	0
they	0
are	0
worried	0
about	0
this	1
you	0
can	0

more	0

Being	0
able	0

the	0
first	0

it!Generally	1

deep	0
fear	0

not	0

what	0

up	0

level	0

sometimes	0
anxiety	0
comes	0
from	0

Hi	0
there,I	0
first	0
want	0
to	0
let	0
you	0
know	0
that	0
having	0
these	0
thoughts	0
is	0
completely	0
normal	2
Studies	0
have	0
been	0
done	0
that	0
show	0
that	0
80%	0
of	0
human	0
thoughts	0
are	0
"negative"	0
so	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
alone. I	0
like	0
to	0
think	0
of	0
thoughts	0
as	0
a	0
tornado..	2
if	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
a	0
tornado	1
you	0
are	0
completely	0
consumed	0
by	0
it	0
and	0
it	0
is	0
nearly	0
impossible	0
to	0
do	0
anything	0
beneficial	2
However	1
when	0
you	0
are	1
let's	0
say	1
a	0
mile	0
away	0
from	0
a	0
tornado	1
it	0
is	0
still	0
scary	0
but	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
option	0
to	0
do	0
something	0
that	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
you	0
such	0
as	0
get	0
shelter	0
or	0
make	0
sure	0
your	0
family	0
and	0
friends	0
are	0
safe. When	0
unhelpful	0
or	0
scary	0
thoughts	0
arise	1
we	0
tend	0
to	0
start	0
a	0
"war"	0
with	0
them	1
which	0
is	0
the	0
equivalent	0
of	0
jumping	0
into	0
the	0
tornado	2
This	0
makes	0
the	0
thoughts	0
and	0
emotions	0
bigger	0
and	0
intensifies	0
the	0
feelings	0
that	0
go	0
with	0
them. So	0
the	0
question	0
I	0
imagine	0
you	0
have	0
is	0
"how	0
do	0
I	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
the	0
tornado?"	0
There	0
are	0
3	0
steps	0
to	0
doing	0
this:Get	0
distance	0
from	0
your	0
thoughts	0
by	0
adding	0
"I	0
am	0
noticing	0
I'm	0
having	0
the	0
thought	0
that...."	0
to	0
the	0
front	0
of	0
them	2
For	0
example	1
"I	0
am	0
noticing	0
I	0
am	0
having	0
the	0
thought	0
that	0
something	0
bad	0
is	0
going	0
to	0
happen	0
to	0
me." 	0
 The	0
purpose	0
of	0
this	0
is	0
not	0
to	0
decrease	0
your	0
fear	0
or	0
get	0
rid	0
of	0
the	0
thought	2
These	0
thoughts	0
might	0
always	0
be	0
there	0
and	0
that	0
is	0
okay	0
because	0
that	0
is	0
how	0
the	0
mind	0
naturally	0
works	0
so	0
struggling	0
with	0
that	0
is	0
a	0
waste	0
of	0
time	0
and	0
energy	2
The	0
purpose	0
is	0
to	0
gain	0
some	0
distance	0
from	0
the	0
thoughts	0
so	0
you	0
don't	0
get	0
swept	0
away	0
by	0
them	2
You	0
can	0
imagine	0
them	0
floating	0
along	0
like	0
leaves	0
in	0
a	0
stream	0
or	0
clouds	0
in	0
the	0
sky	0
(and	0
often	0
the	0
same	0
thought	0
will	0
come	0
back	0
again	0
and	0
again	0
but	0
that's	0
okay..	2
just	0
continue	0
to	0
notice	0
it	0
with	0
curiosity)	2
I	0
imagine	0
the	0
thoughts	0
get	0
in	0
your	0
way	0
of	0
doing	0
what	0
really	0
matters	0
to	0
you	0
so	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
get	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
distance	1
you	0
can	0
do	0
things	0
that	0
are	0
fulfilling	0
and	0
meaningful	0
to	0
you. Tune	0
into	0
your	0
body	0
and	0
notice	0
what	0
sensations	0
come	0
up	0
and	0
where	0
you	0
feel	0
them	0
most	0
intensely	2
Then	0
breathe	0
into	0
them	0
and	0
make	0
room	0
for	0
them	2
Our	0
5	0
main	0
emotions	0
are:	0
joy	1
sadness	1
fear/anxiety	1
shame	1
and	0
anger	2
ALL	0
of	0
these	0
emotions	0
are	0
part	0
of	0
being	0
human	0
and	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
escaping	0
them	2
So	0
again	1
struggling	0
with	0
them	0
ends	0
up	0
intensifying	0
them	2
Instead	1
let	0
them	0
be	0
and	0
make	0
a	0
little	0
bit	0
of	0
room	0
for	0
them	2
Often	0
a	0
side	0
effect	0
of	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
intensity	0
will	0
decrease	0
but	0
it	0
might	0
not	2
The	0
purpose	0
is	0
to	0
keep	0
them	0
from	0
becoming	0
more	0
intense. Contact	0
the	0
present	0
moment	2
Notice	0
what	0
is	0
happening	0
here	0
and	0
now	2
One	0
way	0
of	0
doing	0
this	0
is	0
tuning	0
into	0
the	0
five	0
senses	2
What	0
are	0
some	0
things	0
you	0
hear	1
see	1
taste	1
smell	1
and	0
feel	3
Another	0
way	0
is	0
to	0
notice	0
what	0
is	0
happening	0
in	0
your	0
body	0
(without	0
trying	0
to	0
change	0
it)	2
How	0
deep	0
are	0
your	0
breaths	1
what	0
is	0
happening	0
with	0
your	0
heart	0
rate	1
are	0
you	0
cold/warm	1
etc?Implementing	0
these	0
three	0
steps	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
refrain	0
from	0
getting	0
caught	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
unhelpful	0
thoughts	2
Unfortunately	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
get	0
rid	0
of	0
thoughts	0
or	0
feelings	0
completely	2
So	0
the	0
only	0
option	0
that	0
works	0
in	0
the	0
long	0
run	0
is	0
to	0
accept	0
them	0
while	0
continuing	0
to	0
do	0
what	0
matters	0
to	0
you	0
and	0
what	0
is	0
fulfilling	0
to	0
you.I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps!	0

Counseling	0

a	0
process	1

Hello	1

Bipolar	0

changes	0
in	0
mood	1
ranging	0
from	0
mania	0
(highs)	0
to	0
depression	0
(lows)	2
There	0
are	0
different	0
types;	0
however	1
so	0
here	0
is	0
a website	0
that gives	0
you	0
a	0
list	0

symptoms	0
for	0

depression	0
in	0

reviewing	0
these	0

if	0

believe	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
bipolar	0

then	0
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
see	0
your	0

provider	0
or a	0
counselor	2
Bipolar	0
disorder	0
is	0
treatable	1
but	0
for	0
many	0
people	0
it	0
requires	0
the	0
right	0
medication	0
and	0
sometimes	0
counseling	0
to	0
help	0
people	0
make	0
behavior	0
changes	0
that	0
are	0
important	0
for	0
bipolar	0
management	2
For	0
example	1
some	0
people	0
may	0
not	0
get	0
regular	0
sleep	1
but	0
proper	0
rest	0
is	0
important	0
for	0
bipolar	0
management	2
A	0
counselor	0
may	0
talk	0
to	0
you	0
about	0
this	0
and	0
other	0
lifestyle	0
changes	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
need	0
to	0

is	0
that	0
many	0
people	0
live	0
happy	1
healthy	1
and	0

with	0

So	1
if	0
it	0
turns	0
out	0
that	0
you	0

have	0
bipolar	0

it	0
doesn't	0

There	0

Hello	0

Thank	0

I	0
want	0
to	0
start	0
off	0
by	0
saying	1
in	0
kind	0
of	0
an	0
ironic	0
way	1
your	0
struggle	0
is	0
something	0
many	0
people	0
go	0
through	1
I	0
might	0
say	0
quite	0
often. 	0
Many	0
feel	0
alone	0
with	0
one	0
another	0
quite	0
frequently. 	0
THe	0
reasons	0
for	0
feeling	0
alone	0
vary	0
much	0
between	0
person	0
to	0
person. 	0
In	0
reading	0
how	0
you	0
presented	0
things	1
I	0
will	0
just	0
respond	0
from	0
how	0
this	0
strikes	0
me. 	0
Sometimes	0
feeling	0

might	0
be	0
the	0
result	0
of	0
not	0
completing	0
the	0
second	0
half	0
of	0
the	0
equation;	0

that	0
although	0

it	0
wont	0
necessarily	0
equate	0
the	0

Instead	1
its	0
when you	0

up	0
by	0

to	0
others	0
that you	0
 may	0

never	0

when	0

feelings	1
we	0
are	0
connected. 	0
Second	1
we	0
as	0

may	0
be	0
lacking	0
some	0

 Third;	0

needing	0
from	0
another	0

These	0
are	0
just	0
some	0

Aloneness	0

yet	0
it	0
has	0
much	0
to	0
do	0
with	0

First	0
I	0
think	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
doing	0
something	0
amazing. 	0
You	0
are	0
putting	0
yourself	0
out	0
there	0
and	0
becoming	0
a	0
Water	0
Safety	0
Instructor.  	0
We	0
often	0
times	0
will	0
focus	0
on	0
the	0
negative	0
and	0
forget	0
about	0
the	0
positive. 	0
Next	1
you	0
had	0
an	0
incident	0
where	0
someone	0
pointed	0
something	0
out	0
which	0
may	0
have	0
caused	0
embarrassment. 	0
Whether	0
or	0
not	0
it	0
was	0
malicious	0
on	0
his	0
part	0
I	0
think	0
the	0
important	0
thing	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
is	0
what	0
is	0
called	0
"Common	0
Humanity". 	0
Common	0
Humanity	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
three	0
elements	0
of	0
self-compassion. 	0
Common	0
humanity	0
essentially	0
recognizes	0
that	0
suffering	0
and	0
personal	0
inadequacy	0
is	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
shared	0
human	0
experience. 	0
While	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
had	0
this	0
embarrassing	0
moment	0
at	0
this	0
time	1
that	0
boy	0
may	0
have	0
had	0
an	0
embarrassing	0
moment	0
another	0
day. 	0
We	0
all	0
have	0
embarrassing	0
moments. 	0
When	0
we	0
recognize	0
that	0
we	0
do	0
not	0
suffer	0
in	0
isolation	0
then	0
we	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
move	0
past	0
that	0
suffering. 	0
Additionally	0
another	0
element	0
to	0
self-compassion	0
is	0
self-kindness. 	0
My	0
question	0
is	0
why	0
must	0
you	0
forgive	0
yourself? 	0
Rather	1
be	0
kind	0
to	0
yourself	0
for	0
learning	0
an	0
amazing	0
new	0
talent	2
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you've	0
already	0
learned	0
that	0
just	0
being	0
honest	0
is	0
often	0
the	0
best	0
approach. What	0
do	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
telling	0
your	0
mom	0
how	0
you're	0
feeling	3
 She	0
might	0

it	0
if	0
you	0
also	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
regaining	0
her	0
trust	0
is	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
you. 	0
You	0
have	0
several	0
things	0
going	0
on	0
here	2
The	0
sleep	0
should	0
be	0
addressed	0
with	0
a	0
primary	0
care	0
physician	0
to	0
rule	0
out	0
any	0
physical	0
issues	2
Sleep	0
is	0
the	0
big	0
reset	0
and	0
allows	0
us	0
to	0
function	0
in	0
the	0
day	2
What	0
happens	0
during	0
a	0
depression	0
is	0
that	0
our	0
thoughts	0
race	0
and	0
it	0
is	0
as	0
though	0
our	0
“brain	0
won’t	0
shut	0
off.”	0
Medication	0
can	0
help	0
with	0
this. I	0
also	0
use	0
a	0
Pranayama	0
yoga	0
breathing	0
technique	0
called	0
the	0
four	0
fold	0
breath	0
which	0
has	0
great	0
usefulness	0
for	0
relaxing	0
us	0
 and	0
often	0
does	0
work	0
quite	0
well	0

that	0

100%	0

hope	2

as	0
I	0

it	0

with	0
the	0

there.There	0
is	0
a	0

it's	0
great	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
acknowledge	0
the	0
psychological	0
addiction	0
that	0
exists	2

would	0
be	0
helpful	0
to	0
dive	0
into	0
what	0
that	0
psychological	0
need	0
actually	0
is	1
as	0
it	0
can	0
vary	0
from	0
person	0
to	0
person	0
(whereas	0
the	0

Exploring	0
and	0
getting	0
to	0
the	0

what	0

you	0
psychologically	1

how	0
else	0

those	0

of	0
yours	1

in	0

good	0
about	0
yourself	2
While	0
replacement	0

Watching	0

them	0

know	0
you	0

I	0
am	0

that	0
you	0

already	0
checked	0
with	0

to	0

out	0
any	0

problems	0
that	0
may	0

related	0
to	0
this	2
Assuming	0
that	0
is	0
the	0
case	1
for	0
most	0
this	0
happens	0
for	0
two	0
primary	0
reasons	2
It	0
is	0
either	0
a	0
short	0
term	0
biological	0
shortage	0
of	0
blood	0
flow	0
to	0
the	0

This	0
can	0
be	0
caused	0
my	0

lack	0
of	0

even	0
stress	2
Another	0
primary	0
reason	0
for	0
loss	0
of	0

anxiety	2
Have	0

a	0
few	0
aspects	0
that	0
can	0

loss	0
of	0

My	0
suggestion	0
to	0
you	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
seek	0
out	0
a	0
counselor	0
that	0

First	0
step	0
always	0
is	0
to	0
do	0
a	0
medical	0
rule	0
out	0
so	0
that	0
you're	0
sure	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
psychological	0
and	0
emotion	0
based	1
not	0
a	0

requires	0

attention.If	0
you	0
are	0
medically	0
clear	0
in	0
the	0
reasons	0
for	0
losing	0
your	0
erection	1
then	0
reflect	0
on	0
what	0
may	0
be	0
creating	0
a	0
loss	0
in	0
confidence	0
in	0
either	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
and	0
what	0
you're	0
doing	0
with	0
your	0
life	1
or	0
whether	0
your	0
wife	0
has	0
these	0
sort	0
of	0
problems	0
within	0
herself.Often	0
a	0
problem	0
transfers	0
ownership	0
of	0
who	0
shows	0
it.If	0
you	0
are	0
a	0
sensitive	0
person	0
its	0
possible	0
your	0
erection	0
problem	0
reflects	0
your	0
wife's	0
insecurities	0
and	0
self-doubt	2
 If	0
she	0
is	0
someone	0
who	0
is	0
reluctant	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0

unsure	0
then	0
in	0
a	0
certain	0
way	0
by	0
you	0
showing	0
a	0
problem	1
she	0
can	0
avoid	0
looking	0
at	0
herself.There	0
may	0
not	0
be	0
a	0
direct	0
cause	0
such	0
as	0
usually	0
exists	0
in	0
a	0
medical	0
problem.Medicine	0
looks	0
for	0
symptoms	0
to	0
treat.Our	0
emotional	0
lives	0
are	0
much	0
more	0
indirect.If	0
you	0
feel	0

at	0
work	0
or	0
are	0
unhappy	0
in	0
the	0
place	0
you	0
live	1
for	0
example	1
then	0
your	0
frustration	0
may	0
show	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
sex	0
life.Basically	1
do	0
a	0
broad	0
inward	0
search	0
of	0
your	0
life	0
and	0
what	0
it	0
holds	0
and	0
maybe	0
ask	0
your	0
wife	0
to	0
do	0
the	0
same.You	0
may	0
clear	0
the	0
air	0
within	0
yourselves	0

between	0
each	0

the	0

Hello	2
I	0
have	0
to	0
wonder	0
from	0
a	0
behavioral	0
perspective	0
if	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
doing	0
is	0
useful	0
for	0
you	2
In	0
other	0
words	1
does	0
it	0
serve	0
a	0
purpose	0
in	0
some	0
way	0
when	0
you	0
find	0
yourself	0
doing	0
it	2
Yes	1
this	0
could	0
well	0
be	0
an	0
expression	0
of	0
anxiety	1
or	0
maybe	0
some	0
type	0
of	0
coping	0
skill	0
you	0
have	0
developed	0
over	0
the	0
years	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
stressful	0
situations	2
Yet	0
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
developed	0
a	0
sort	0
of	0
knee-jerk	0
behavioral	0
conditioning	0
that	0
causes	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
this	0
behavior	0
during	0
specific	0
(or	0
perhaps	0
even	0
non-specific)	0
circumstances	2
Do	0
you	0
think	0
it	0
is	0
a	0
self-soothing	0
behavior	3
Do	0
you	0
feel	0
good	0
after	0
you	0
have	0
done	0
it	3
The	0
behavior	0
itself	0
is	0
likely	0
causing	0
some	0
form	0
of	0
slow	0
physical	0
damage	1
so	0
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
you	0
have	0
yourself	0
checked	0
by	0
a	0
doctor	1
to	0
rule	0
out	0
any	0
injury	2
If	0
none	0
exists	1
this	0
obviously	0
doesn't	0
excuse	0
the	0
behavior	1
it	0

I	0

the	0

thing	0
you	0

is	0
be	0
respectful	0

each	0
family	0
member's	0

Although	0
everyone	0
may	0
not	0
agree	0
with	0
one	0
another	1
the	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
each	0
other	0
is	0
to	0
respect	0
their	0
faith	0
and	0
beliefs	0
instead	0
of	0
trying	0
to	0
sway	0
them	0
in	0
a	0
certain	0
direction. There	0
are	0
many	0
families	0
that	0
are	0
united	0
despite	0
their	0
differences	2
For	0
example	1
a	0
mother	0
may	0
be	0
Catholic	0
and	0
the	0
father	0
Jewish	2
By	0
introducing	0
the	0
children	0
to	0
each	0
faith	0
until	0
they	0
are	0
ready	0
to	0
decide	0
for	0
themselves	0
can	0
be	0
beneficial. Also	1
it's	0
not	0
uncommon	0
for	0
views	0
to	0
change	0
as	0
one	0
ages	0
or	0
faces	0
different	0
life	0
experiences	2
So	0
don't	0
get	0
too	0
discouraged	0
if	0
your	0
child	0
wants	0
to	0
explore	0
different	0
avenues. Creating	0
a	0
loving	0
and	0
accepting	0
environment	0
is	0
most	0
essential	2
Conflict	0
is	0
a	0
tricky	0
beast	0
and	0
shows	0
up	0
in	0
every one	0
of	0
our	0
relationships. What	0
I'm	0
reading	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
find	0
yourself	0
in	0
a	0
loop	0
of	0
 seeking	0
validation	0
of	0

a	0

proposition	0
which	0

Ultimately	1
as	0
an	0

he	0

if	0

 How	0
does	0
his	0

affect	0
you	3
That's	0
where	0
your	0

has	0
power	1
rather	0
than	0
in	0
counting	0

(when	0
he's	0
passed	0
out	1

You've	0

I	0

a	0
legitimate	0
complaint	2
If	0
he's	0

that's	0

'check	0

the	0

All	0
of	0

I'd	0
stick	0
to	0
talking	0
about	0
those	0
rather	0
than	0

My	0
guess	0
is	0
he	0
has	0
few	0
other	0
ways	0
to	0
cope	0
with	0
stress	1
so	0
he	0
checks	0
out	0
with	0
alcohol	1
and	0
it	0
also	0
helps	0
him	0
avoid	0
your	0
relationship	2
But	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
it	0
makes	0
it	0
worse;	0
the	0
more	0
he	0
avoids	0
you	1
then	0
more	0
you	0
chase	0
him	0
with	0
your	0
questions.There's	0
a	0

here	2

the	0

you.If	0
you	0
state	0
your	0

your	0

for	0
the	0
truth	1
ideally	0
he	0
will	0
produce	0
enough	0
evidence	0
of	0
the	0
truth	0
so	0
you	0
will	0
have	0
facts	0
and	0
can	0
make	0
sense	0
of	0
them	2
 	0
Hopefully	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you	0
will	0
do	0
this	0
sense	0
making	0
together	1
especially	0
if	0
he	0
did	0
have	0

w	0
the	0
prostititute.If	0
he's	0
unwilling	0
to	0
care	0
about	0
restoring	0
your	0
trust	0
in	0
him	1
then	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
different	0
problem	0
entirely	2
The	0
therapeutic	0
relationship	0
should	0
be	0
collaborative	2
 The	0
client	0
is	0
the	0
expert	0
on	0
their	0
life	1
and	0
the	0
therapist	0
is	0
the	0
expert	0
on	0
helping	0
the	0
client	0
to	0
develop	0
their	0
sense	0
of	0
being	2
Growth	0
occurs	0
as	0
a	0
result	0
of	0
challenges	2
Therefore	1
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
not	0
looking	0
to	0
train	0
the	0
therapist	1
but	0
rather	0
to	0
find	0
one	0
that	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
develop	0
into	0
the	0
you	0
that	0
you	0
desire	0
to	0
be	2
Finding	0
the	0
right	0
therapist	0
is	0
like	0
finding	0
a	0
pair	0
of	0
black	0
heels	2
Not	0
just	0
any	0
black	0
heels	0
will	0
do	2
But	0
when	0
you	0
find	0
them	1
you	0
just	0
know	0
that	0
your	0
search	0
is	0
over	2
It	0
is	0
also	0
wise	0
to	0
expect	0
that	0
they	0
won’t	0
always	0
feel	0
comfortable	2
Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
First	1
I	0
want	0
you	0
to	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
certainly	0
not	0
alone	0
on	0
this	0
issue. Everyone	1
at some	0
point	0
in	0
time	1
has	0
a	0
fear	0
of	0
public	0
embarrassment	2
But	0
for	0
many people	1
this	0
fear	0
can	0
become so	0
awful	0
that	0
it	0
begins	0
to have	0
a	0
real	0
negative	0
impact	0
on	0
their	0
quality	0
of	0
life.  They	0
will try	0
to	0
avoid	0
any	0
situation	0
that	0
they	0
even	0
THINK	0
will	0
cause	0
them	0
embarrassment	0
or	0
anxiety	2
Escaping	0
a	0
possible	0
embarrassing	0
moment	0
by	0
avoiding	0
or	0
isolating	0
may	0
cause	0
some	0
relief	0
at	0
first	1
but	0
then	0
many	0
times	0
the	0
avoidance	0
will	0
eventually lead	0
to	0
loneliness	1
isolation	1
and	0
even	0
despair	2
By	0
avoiding	1
we	0
can	0
also	0
miss	0
out	0
on	0
things	0
that	0
make	0
us	0
feel	0
alive	0
and	0
bring	0
enjoyment	2
There	0
are	0
many	0
self-help	0
books	0
that	0
offer	0
advice	0
on	0
this	0
issue	2
You	0
can	0
do	0
an	0
internet	0
search	1
and	0
I	0
recommend	0
reading	0
the	0
reviews	0
of	0
the	0
book	2
That	0
is 	0
great	0
way	0
to	0
find	0
out	0
if	0
others	0
have	0
found	0
the	0
book	0
helpful	2
Another	0
option	0
is	0
to	0
seek	0
a	0
counselor	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
with	0
this	0
fear. I	0
would	0
recommend	0
a	0
counselor	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
helping	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
anxiety	0
or	0
social	0
anxiety	2
Acceptance	0
and	0
Commitment	0
Therapy	0
is 	0
a	0
good	0
choice	0
for	0
helping	0
with	0
anxiety	1
but	0
there	0
are	0
many	0
others	2
The	0
truth	0
is	0
that	0
anxiety	0
and	0
fear	0
of	0
embarrassing	0
ourselves	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
that	0
any	0
of	0
us	0
will	0
ever	0
"get	0
over"	1

we	0
can	0

 Generally	1
the	0

to	0
listen	0
to	0
each	0

what	0
you	0

so	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
look	0
at	0
what	0
may	0
work	0
for	0
both	0
of	0
you	2
For	0
example	1
maybe	0
you	0
could	0
remind	0
yourself	0
that	0

answer	0
you	0
when	0
he	0
is	0
not	0
busy	0

as	0
soon	0
as	0
he	0
can.Sometimes	0
just	0
talking	0
about	0
these	0
feelings	0
can	0
be	0
helpful	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
can	0
both	0
have	0
open	0
discussions	0
about	0
whether	0
the	0
amount	0

type	0
of	0

in	0
a	0
style	0
that	0

for	0
both	0
of	0
you	2
You	0
could	0
also	0
consider	0
leaving	0
text	0
messages	0

something	0
that	0
does	0
not	0
require	0
an	0

that	0

you	0

has	0
the	0

also	0
wonder	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
getting	0
the	0
idea	0
that	0
something	0

happened	2
I	0
don't	0

whether	0
something	0

this	0
is	0
difficult	0
for	0

considering	0
what	0
makes	0
each	0
of	0
you	0
feel	0
loved	1

special.Also	0
think	0
about	0
what	0

what	0

is	0
not	0

it	0

first	0
(such	0

taking	0
