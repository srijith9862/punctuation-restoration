Recovering	0
from	0
one	0
is	0
a	0
process	0
that	0
is	0
unique	0
for	0
everyone	0
person	0
and	0
will	0
take	0
time	2
It's	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
don't	0
compare	0
yourself	0
to	0
others	2
Each	0
and	0
every	0
person	0
will	0
experience	0
this	0
grieving	0
process	0
differently	2
Here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
tips	0
to	0
help	0
with	0
your	0
recovery: 1	2
Make	0
sure	0
you	0
surround	0
yourself	0
with	0
people	0
who	0
love	0
you	0
and	0
support	0
you	1
friends	0
and	0
family	2
Even	0
though	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
like	0
being	0
alone	1
make	0
an	0
effort	0
to	0
be	0
around	0
them. 2	2
Although	0
you	0
might	0
not	0
feel	0
like	0
it	1
try	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
possible:	0
eat	0
healthily	1
get	0
regular	0
sleep	1
&	0
vigorous	0
or	0
gentle	0
exercise	0
(depending	0
on	0
your	0
mood)	2
The	0
last	0
thing	0
that	0
we	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
physically	0
sick	0
(e.g	2
flu)	0
is	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
ourselves	0
even	0
thought	0
that's	0
what	0
we	0
need	0
the	0
most	2
But	0
when	0
we	0
do	0
get	0
that	0
chicken	0
broth	1
sleep	0
and	0
vitamins	0
we	0
recover	0
much	0
faster	0
and	0
with	0
less	0
discomfort	2
That's	0
exactly	0
the	0
same	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
emotional pain	2
Take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	1
keep yourself	0
strong	0
and	0
healthy	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
recover	0
faster. 3	2
As	0
much	0
as	0
possible	1
put	0
away	0
reminders	0
of	0
the	0
relationship	2
You	0
might	0
not	0
be	0
ready	0
to	0
throw	0
things	0
out	1
but	0
try	0
to	0
put	0
them	0
away	0
in	0
a	0
box	0
in	0
the	0
storage	0
or	0
in	0
a	0
closet	2
And	0
also	0
block	0
Social	0
Media	0
reminders	2
There	0
is	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
wisdom	0
in	0
the	0
saying	0
"Out	0
of	0
Sight	1
Out	0
of	0
Mind." 4	2
Once	0
the	0
initial	0
shock	0
and	0
intensity	0
of	0
the	0
break	0
up	0
wear	0
off	1
try	0
out	0
something	0
new	2
In	0
a	0
relationship	1
we	0
often	0
forget	0
and	0
give	0
up	0
on	0
things	0
that	0
we	0
always	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	0
or	0
to	0
try	2
Now	0
it's	0
time	0
to	0
bring	0
out	0
that	0
dusty	0
bucket	0
list	0
and	0
start	0
trying	0
something	0
new. 5	2
If	0
possible	1
change	0
your	0
scenery	0
by	0
going	0
away	0
on	0
vacation	0
with	0
a	0
friend	0
or	0
even	0
by	0
yourself	2
Changing	0
your	0

can	0
really	0
help	0
you	0
change	0
your	0
thoughts	1
mindset and	0
forget	0
your	0

even	0

a	0

Even	0
a	0

wonders. 6	2
In	0

I	0

highly	0

about	0

allow	0
for	0

Hi	0
Bend	1
You're	0

right	3
That	0
makes	0
sense	2
Each	0
time	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
break-up	0
we	0
are	0
a	0
bit	0
more	0
in	0

with	0
how	0

in	0
this	0

that's	0
okay	2
We	0

of	0
what	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
say	0
here	0

don't	0
pressure	0
yourself	0
too	0
much	2
Take	0
the	0
time	0
to	0
heal	0
naturally	0
and	0
listen	0
to	0
your	0
instinct	0

is	0
telling	0

to	0
take	0
things	0
slow	2
:)As	0

down	1
or	0
will	0
come	0
down	0
for	0

Yes	1
it	0
is	0

to	0

C	0
It	0
sound	0
like	0
there	0
are	0
some	0
parts	0
of	0
your	0

that	0
you	0

it	0

also	0
some	0

you	0
feel	0

nothing	0
more	0
than	0
a	0

so	0
I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0
could	0
make	0
a	0
list	0
of	0
what	0
else	0
you	0
are	0
(friend	1

I	0
also	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0
could	0
list	0
your	0
positive	0
attributes	0
or	0
skills.I	0
don't	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
gave	0
up	1
but	0
I	0
wonder	0
if	0
there	0
is	0
some	0
way	0
that	0
you	0
could	0
spend	0
an	0
hour	0
or	0
so	0
a	0
week	0
working	0
on	0
things	0
that	0
you	0

spending	0
some	0
time	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
did	0
before	0
you	0
had	0
children	2
For	0
example	1
if	0
you're	0
missing	0
a	0
certain	0
part	0
of	0
your	0
career	1
maybe	0
you	0
could	0
work	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
to	0
come	0
up	0
with	0
a	0
plan	0
where	0
you	0
could	0
do	0
whenever	0
that	0
is	0
for	0
one	0
day	0
a	0
week	2
There	0
are	0
often	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
small	0
changes	0
that	0
can	0
lead	0
you	0
in	0
that	0
direction.Of	0
course	1
that	0
is	0
assuming	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
continue	0
being	0
involved	0
with	0
what	0
you	0
were	0
doing	0
before	2

is	0
it	0
that	0

What	0
do	0
you	0

Remember	0
that	0
looking	0

to	0
having	0
an	0
hour	0
or	0
two	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
something	0
for	0

does	0
not	0
mean	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
a	0

 The	0

Hi	0
Portland,This	0
must	0

I	0
get	0
how	0
upsetting	0
this	0
is.If	0
I	0
was	0
your	0
therapist	1
I'd	0
want	0
to	0
explore	0
this	0
a	0
good	0
deal	1
because	0
there	0
are	0
several	0
possibilities	0
concerning	0
what	0
might	0
be	0
happening	2
Be	0
careful	0
not	0
to	0

to	0
conclusions. Sometimes	0
people	0
have	0

slowly	0
"falling	0
out	0
of	0

for	0
a	0

this	0
is	0
due	0
to	0
some	0
(perhaps	0
unnamed)	0
unmet	0
need	0
in	0
the	0
marriage	2
She	0
may	0
have	0

to	0
this	0
point	0
over	0
a	0
period	0
of	0
time	1
and	0
has	0
only	0
finally	0
said	0
so. It's	0
also	0

that	0
your	0

is	0
going	0
through	0
some	0
temporary	0
crisis...she's	0
changing	0
and	0
personally	0
unhappy	0

the	0

Only	0
she	0
can	0
help	0
herself	0
through	0
this	0
(she	0
could	0
get	0
the	0
help	0
of	0
a	0
therapist	1
but	0
it's	0
not	0
your	0

it's	0

 Right	0
now	1
it's	0

that	0
you	0

your	0

if	0
she's	0

We	0

If	0

then	0
it's	0

her	0
that.That	0

mean	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
give	0
up	0
on	0
the	0

right	0
now	2
I	0
would	0
seek	0
the	0
support	0
of	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
sort	0
out	0
what	0
YOU	0
want;	0
whether	0
it's	0
to	0
move	0
on	0
with	0
your	0
life	1

wait	0
patiently	0
for	0
a	0
period	0
of	0
time. I	0
can't	0
predict	0
what	0
will	0
happen	0
here	2
But	0
you	0
can	0
find	0
out	0
what	0
the	0
best	0
path	0
for	0
you	0
is	2
I	0
wish	0
you	0
the	0
best	2
I	0
can	0
relate!	0
When	0
things	0
are	0
going	0
badly	1
I	0
feel	0
like	0
my	0
life	0
has	0
always	0
been	0
and	0
will	0
always	0
be	0
that	0
way	2
(But	0
I	0
also	0
do	0
this	0
when	0
things	0
are	0
going	0
well	2
That	0
is	1
I	0
forget	0
how	0
good	0
things	0
can	0
turn	0
bad	2
Personally	1
to	0
avoid	0
this	0
emotional	0
roller-coaster	1
I	0
try	0
and	0
heed	0
the	0
famous	0
advice	0
by	0
author	0
and	0
feminist	0
Rita	0
Mae	0
Brown:	0
"One	0
of	0
the	0
keys	0
to	0
happiness	0
is	0
a	0
bad	0
memory."So	0
maybe	0
this	0
weakness	0
of	0
your	0
for	0
forgetting	0
is	0
really	0
a	0
strength!	0
It	0
sounds	0
a	0
lot	0
like	0
living	0
in	0
the	0
moment	0
to	0
me	2
And	0
while	0
it’s	0
hard	0
to	0
manage	0
my	0
past	0

the	0

seems	0
like	0
a	0
small	0
enough	0
piece	0
of	0
temporal	0
real	0
estate	0
to	0
sort	0
out	2
So	0
that’s	0
the	0
“what”	0
of	0
my	0
answer	2

Sounds	0
like	0
it	0
is	0
time	0
to	0
set	0
some	0
boundaries	0
with	0
your	0
mom. 	0
You	0
can	0
do	0
this	0
by	0
letting	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
understand	0
how	0
she	0
is	0
feeling	0
and	0
you	0
understand	0
that	0
she	0
is	0
under	0
a	0
tremendous	0
amount	0
of	0
stress. 	0
Validate	0
her	0
feelings	0
and	0
words. 	0
After	0
you	0
do	0
that	1
tell	0
her	0
how	0
hearing	0
about	0
it	0
daily	0
is	0
affecting	0
you	0
let. 	0
Let	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
hard	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
hear	0
how	0
stressed	0
she	0

how	0
hard	0
it	0
is	0
you	0
to	0
have	0
these	0
daily	0
calls. 	0
Let	0
her	0
know	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
stressed	0
about	0
her	0
own	0
well	0
being. 	0
You	0
can	0
then	0
suggest	0
that	0
she	0
find	0
a	0
therapist	0
to	0
speak	0
to	0
about	0
how	0
she	0
is	0
feeling	0
and	0
what	0
she	0
is	0
going	0
through. 	0
I	0
suggest	0
writing	0
out	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
say	1
before	0
you	0
say	0
it. 	0
Practice	0
saying	0
it	0
a	0
few	0
times	0
so	0
that	0
it	0
flows	0
naturally	0
when	0
you	0
do	0
have	0
the	0
conversation	0
with	0
her.Also	1
when	0
you	0
start	0
setting	0
boundaries	0
with	0
people	0
they	0
don't	0
usually	0
like	0
it. 	0
They	0
give	0
some	0
sort	0
of	0
push	0
back	0
either	0
by	0
expressing	0
disappointment	0
or	0
anger	0
towards	0
you. 	0
This	0
has	0
nothing	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
you. 	0
This	0
is	0
them	0
having	0
a	0
hard	0
time	0
hearing	0
and	0
accepting	0
the	0
boundary	0
you	0
are	0
setting. 	0
The	0
other	0
thing	0
people	0
tend	0
to	0
do	0
when	0
you	0
set	0
a	0
boundary	0
is	0
to	0
test	0
it. 	0
In	0
this	0
situation	0
it	0
might	0
look	0
like	0
your	0
mom	0
calling	0
you	0
the	0
next	0
day	0
as	0
if	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you	0
never	0
had	0
the	0
conversation. 	0
In	0
this	0
situation	0
it	0
falls	0
on	0
you	0
to	0
set	0
the	0
boundary	0
again	1
by	0
having	0
the	0
same	0
conversation	0
again	0
with	0
her. 	0
Over	0
time	0
she	0
will	0
accept	0
the	0
boundary	0
and	0
she	0
will	0
be	0
OK	0
with	0
it	2
One	0
thing	0
you	0
could	0
try	0
is	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
conversation	0
when	0
neither	0
of	0
you	0
is	0
upset	0
so	0
that	0
you	0
learn	0
what	0
makes	0
each	0
of	0
you	0
feel	0
cared	0
for	0
and	0
valued	2
It	0
could	0
be	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
showing	0
caring	0
in	0
a	0
way	0
that	0
doesn't	0
quite	0
match	0
what	0
she	0
is	0
really	0
looking	0
for	0
in	0
that	0
moment	2
For	0
example	1
having	0
an	0
in-depth	0
conversation	0
could	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
you	0
want	1
but	0
she	0
may	0
just	0
want	0
a	0
hug	0
in	0
that	0
moment. I	0
don't	0
know	0
if	0
you	0

question	0

exercise	0
for	0

this	0
that	0

checks	0
for	0
understanding	2

it	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
The	0
question	0
about	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
to	0
cheat	0
is	0
based	0
on	0
personal	0
values	0
that	0
can	0
only	0
be	0
answered	0
by	0
you	2
However	1
here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
to	0
consider	0
and	0
questions	0
to	0
ask	0
yourself	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
find	0
your	0
answer:	0
1.    	0
Do	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
violating	0
your	0
own	0
values	0
or	0
morals	3
This	0
is	0
important	1
because	0
we	0
all	0
have	0
different	0
values	0
and	0
morals	0
surrounding	0
sex	1
love	1
and	0
monogamy	2
If	0
you	0
value	0
monogamous	0
relationships	0
and	0
find	0
yourself	0
cheating	0
on	0
your	0
partner	1
then	0
you	0
may	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
living	0
in	0
contradiction	0
to	0
your	0
values	1
and	0
most	0
people	0
are	0
not	0
happy	0
when	0
they	0
do	0
that	2
However	1
if	0
monogamy	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
you	0
value	1
then	0
perhaps	0
it	0
is	0
time	0
to	0
re-evaluate	0
the	0
relationship	0
and	0
determine	0
if	0
it	0
is	0
still	0
right	0
for	0
you	2
Not	0
all	0
people	0
want	0
monogamous	0
relationships	1
and	0
that	0
is	0
alright	2
Finally, if	0
you	0
value	0
your	0
husband’s	0
feelings	0
and	0
know	0
that	0
the	0
affairs	0
would	0
hurt	0
him	1
then	0
your	0
behaviors	0
may	0
again	0
be	0
in	0
contrast	0
to	0
your	0
own	0
values	2
That	0
can	0
only	0
be	0
determined	0
by	0
you	2
2.      Based	0
on	0
how	0
you	0
describe	0
your	0
relationship	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
very	0
satisfied	0
with	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
is. 	0
From	0
the	0
outside	1
it	0
looks	0
like	0
the	0
affairs	0
are	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
“get	0
even”	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
or	0
to	0
feel	0
better	0
after	0

when	0

First	0
I	0
think	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
you	0
are	0

something	0
amazing. 	0
You	0
are	0
putting	0
yourself	0
out	0
there	0
and	0
becoming	0
a	0
Water	0
Safety	0
Instructor.  	0
We	0
often	0
times	0
will	0
focus	0
on	0
the	0
negative	0
and	0
forget	0
about	0
the	0
positive. 	0
Next	1
you	0
had	0
an	0
incident	0
where	0
someone	0
pointed	0
something	0
out	0
which	0
may	0
have	0
caused	0
embarrassment. 	0
Whether	0
or	0
not	0
it	0
was	0
malicious	0
on	0
his	0
part	0
I	0
think	0
the	0
important	0
thing	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
is	0
what	0
is	0
called	0
"Common	0
Humanity". 	0
Common	0
Humanity	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
three	0
elements	0
of	0
self-compassion. 	0
Common	0
humanity	0
essentially	0
recognizes	0
that	0
suffering	0
and	0
personal	0
inadequacy	0
is	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
shared	0
human	0
experience. 	0
While	0
you	0
may	0
have	0
had	0
this	0
embarrassing	0
moment	0
at	0
this	0
time	1
that	0
boy	0
may	0
have	0
had	0
an	0
embarrassing	0
moment	0
another	0
day. 	0
We	0
all	0
have	0
embarrassing	0
moments. 	0
When	0
we	0
recognize	0
that	0
we	0
do	0
not	0
suffer	0
in	0
isolation	0
then	0
we	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
move	0
past	0
that	0
suffering. 	0
Additionally	0
another	0
element	0
to	0
self-compassion	0
is	0
self-kindness. 	0
My	0
question	0
is	0
why	0
must	0
you	0
forgive	0
yourself? 	0
Rather	1
be	0
kind	0
to	0
yourself	0
for	0
learning	0
an	0
amazing	0

Hello	0

for	0
a	0

 There	0

causes	2
 If	0
you	0
were	0
being	0

 Some	0
questions	0

The	0
behaviors	0
you	0
describe	0
are	0
boundary	0
violations. 	0
You	0
can	0
not	0
change	0
your	0

you	0
can	0
respond	0
to	0

Finding	0

If	0

there	0
anything	0

you	0
this	0
impression	3
If	0
your	0

it	0

Additionally	1
working	0
with	0
a	0
competent	0
therapist	0
may	0
be	0
a	0
great	0
way	0
to	0
get	0
an	0
answer	0
to	0

question	0
as	0
well	0
as	0
developing	0
ways	0
to	0
move	0
forward	0
with	0
that	0
answer	0
and	0
gain	0
a	0
sense	0
of	0
self-esteem	0
and	0
security	0
in	0
your	0
relationships.One	0
possibility	0
that	0
comes	0
to	0

of	0
which	0
there	0
may	0

is	0
that	0
as	0
we	0
grow	0
up	1
we	0
often	0
develop	0
relational	0
templates	1

sets	0
of	0
expectations	0
about	0
how	0
people	0
are	0

will	0
relate	0

Sometimes	0
the	0
templates	0
that	0
we	0
develop	0
to	0
stay	0
connected	0
growing	0
up	0
are	0
not	0
particularly	0
adaptive	0
for	0

can	0
hamper	0
our	0
self-esteem	0
and	0
capacity	0
for	0

as	0
an	0
adult	2
You	0
ask	0
a	0
great	0
question	0
here	1
and	0
one	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
hard	0
to	0
see	0
through	1

the	0
difficulty	0
of	0
feeling	0
that	0

I	0
hope	0
that	0
you	0

stay	0

about	0

and	0
consider	0
working	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
is	0
trained	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
discover	0
the	0
answer	2
I'm	0
sorry	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
tried	0
several	0
different	0
things	0
and	0
not	0
had	0
much	0
relief.I	0
will	0
say	0
that	0
there	0
are	0
several	0
different	0
types	0
of	0
medications	0
that	0
may	0
help	0
and	0
each	0
therapist	0
is	0
different	1
so	0
it	0
is	0
quite	0
possible	0
that	0
a	0
different	0
combination	0
of	0
things	0
you've	0
already	0
tried	0
may	0
be	0
helpful.I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
continue	0
trying	0
different	0
therapists	2
I	0
would	0
say	0
to	0
give	0
each	0
one	0
at	0
least	0
six	0
sessions	0
before	0
you	0
decide	0
that	0
the	0
approach	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
using	0
is	0
not	0
working	0
for	0
you	2
Also	1
most	0
places	0
have	0
a	0
certain	0
sort	0
of	0
structured	0
initial	0
session	0
that	0
must	0
be	0
done	1
but	0
after	0
that	1
the	0
decisions	0
are	0
largely	0
up	0
to	0
what	0
you	0
and	0
the	0
clinician	0
feel	0
is	0
helping	2
If	0
something	0
is	0
or	0
is	0
not	0
working	1
communicate	0
this	0
with	0
your	0
therapist	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
big	0
deal	2
Most	0
therapists	0
I	0
know	0
actually	0
welcome	0
this	0
feedback.There	0
is	0
a	0
fair	0
amount	0
of	0
research	0
into	0
the	0
idea	0
that	0
the	0
therapeutic	0
alliance	0
(the	0
relationship	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
in	0
the	0
context	0
of	0
working	0
through	0
the	0
reasons	0
that	0
brought	0
you	0
into	0
therapy)	0
is	0
very	0
important	2
Also	1
sometimes	0
anxiety	0
and	0
depression	0
can	0
make	0
it	0
difficult	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
therapy	0
on	0
a	0
regular	0
basis	2
If	0
that	0
is	0
something	0
with	0
which	0
you	0
are	0
struggling	1
I	0
would	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
talk	0
about	0
that	0

well.In	0

to	0
a	0
solid	0
relationship	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0

Hey	1
dogs	0
are	0
cool	2
They	0
adore	0
pleasing	0
humans	0
and	0
often	0
LOVE	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
learning	0
what	0
you	0
want	0
and	0
expect	0
from	0
them. Your	0
girlfriend	0
on	0
the	0
other	0
hand	1
likely	0
has	0
her	0
own	0
desires	0
and	0
needs	0
that	0
she	0
attend	0
to	0
before	0
tuning	0
into	0
yours	2
You	0
are	0
good	0
with	0
dogs	1
that	0
tells	0
me	0
that	0
you've	0
spent	0
some	0
time	0
observing	0
their	0
behavior	2
The	0
first	0
step	0
in	0
working	0
through	0
this	0
issue	0
would	0
be	0
similar	1
start	0
to	0
tune	0
into	0
and	0
observe	0
your	0
girlfriend	0
more	0
often..	2
Observation	0
is	0
a	0
skill	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
relationship	0
building	2
The	0
skills	0
you	0
have	0
mastered	0
in	0
relating	0
with	0
your	0
dogs	0
can	0
carry	0
over	1
you	0
will	0
just	0
have	0
to	0
relearn	0
what	0
behaviors	0
you	0
are	0
watching	2
And	0
keep	0
in	0
mind	0
that	0
also	0
means	0
observing	0
yourself	0
in	0
relationships. 	0
Going	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
experience	0
counselor	0
would	0
be	0
my	0
advice	2
 You	0
will	0
have	0
a	0
neutral	0
person	0
that	0
can	0
listen	0
to	0
both	0
sides	0
and	0
help	0
you	0
all	0
find	0
a	0
common	0
ground	0
of	0
understanding	2
 If	0
she	0
doesn't	0
agree	0
to	0
counseling	1
really	0
the	0
only	0
person	0
you	0
can	0
change	0
is	0
you	2
 I	0
would	0
suggest	0
that	0
you	0
approach	0
her	0
with	0
love	0
and	0
let	0
her	0
know	0
what	0
you	0
appreciate	0
about	0
her	1
let	0
her	0
know	0
the	0
great	0
things	0
she	0
have	0
done	0
that	0
could	0
not	0
be	0
replaced	0
or	0
forgotten	0
however	0
you	0
want	0
your	0
relationship	0
to	0
get	0
better	0
than	0
it	0
has	0
been	0
lately	2
 Hopefully	0
this	0
will	0
open	0
the	0
door	0
of	0
communication	0
where	0
you	0
can	0
explain	0
your	0
thoughts	0
and	0
feeling	0
but	0
in	0
a	0
loving	0
way	2

one	0
way	0
to	0

Recovering	0
from	0
one	0
is	0
a	0
process	0
that	0
is	0
unique	0
for	0
everyone	0
person	0
and	0
will	0
take	0
time	2
It's	0
important	0
that	0

compare	0
yourself	0

will	0
experience	0
this	0
grieving	0
process	0
differently	2
Here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
tips	0
to	0
help	0
with	0
your	0
recovery: 1	2
Make	0
sure	0
you	0
surround	0
yourself	0
with	0
people	0
who	0
love	0
you	0
and	0
support	0
you	1
friends	0
and	0
family	2
Even	0
though	0
you	0
might	0
feel	0
like	0
being	0
alone	1
make	0
an	0
effort	0
to	0
be	0
around	0
them. 2	2
Although	0
you	0
might	0
not	0
feel	0
like	0
it	1
try	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
possible:	0
eat	0
healthily	1
get	0
regular	0
sleep	1
&	0
vigorous	0
or	0
gentle	0
exercise	0
(depending	0
on	0
your	0
mood)	2
The	0
last	0
thing	0
that	0
we	0
want	0
to	0
do	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
physically	0
sick	0
(e.g	2
flu)	0
is	0
to	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
ourselves	0
even	0
thought	0
that's	0
what	0
we	0
need	0
the	0
most	2
But	0
when	0
we	0
do	0
get	0
that	0
chicken	0
broth	1
sleep	0
and	0
vitamins	0
we	0
recover	0
much	0
faster	0
and	0
with	0
less	0
discomfort	2
That's	0
exactly	0
the	0
same	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
emotional pain	2
Take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	1
keep yourself	0
strong	0
and	0
healthy	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
recover	0
faster. 3	2
As	0
much	0
as	0
possible	1
put	0
away	0
reminders	0
of	0
the	0
relationship	2
You	0
might	0
not	0
be	0
ready	0
to	0
throw	0
things	0
out	1
but	0
try	0
to	0
put	0
them	0
away	0
in	0
a	0
box	0
in	0
the	0
storage	0
or	0
in	0
a	0
closet	2
And	0
also	0
block	0
Social	0
Media	0
reminders	2
There	0
is	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
wisdom	0
in	0
the	0
saying	0
"Out	0
of	0
Sight	1
Out	0
of	0
Mind." 4	2
Once	0
the	0
initial	0
shock	0
and	0
intensity	0
of	0
the	0
break	0
up	0
wear	0
off	1
try	0
out	0
something	0
new	2
In	0
a	0
relationship	1
we	0
often	0
forget	0
and	0
give	0
up	0
on	0
things	0
that	0
we	0
always	0
wanted	0
to	0
do	0
or	0
to	0
try	2
Now	0
it's	0
time	0
to	0
bring	0
out	0
that	0
dusty	0
bucket	0
list	0
and	0
start	0
trying	0
something	0
new. 5	2
If	0
possible	1
change	0
your	0
scenery	0
by	0
going	0
away	0
on	0
vacation	0
with	0
a	0
friend	0
or	0
even	0
by	0
yourself	2
Changing	0
your	0
surroundings	0
can	0
really	0
help	0
you	0
change	0
your	0
thoughts	1
mindset and	0
forget	0
your	0
ex	0
even	0
if	0
just	0
for	0
a	0
few	0
hours	2
Even	0
a	0

wonders. 6	2
In	0

you	0
make	0
sense	0
of	0
your	0
past	0

what	0
went	0
wrong	1
I	0
would	0
highly	0

a	0

therapist	2
It’s	0
very	0
normal	0
to	0

You	0

The	0

about	0

that	0

Outside	0
this	1

a	0

however	0
some	0

these	0

this	0
is	0
something	0
to	0
check	0
in	0
with	0
both	0
with	0
the	0
light	0
box	0
manufacturer	0

with	0
your	0

Hello	1
and	0
thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
The	0
question	0
about	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
to	0
cheat	0
is	0
based	0
on	0
personal	0
values	0
that	0
can	0
only	0
be	0
answered	0
by	0
you	2
However	1
here	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
to	0
consider	0
and	0
questions	0
to	0
ask	0
yourself	0
to	0
help	0
you	0
find	0
your	0
answer:	0
1.    	0
Do	0
you	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
violating	0
your	0
own	0
values	0
or	0
morals	3
This	0
is	0
important	1
because	0
we	0
all	0
have	0
different	0
values	0
and	0
morals	0
surrounding	0
sex	1
love	1
and	0
monogamy	2
If	0
you	0
value	0
monogamous	0
relationships	0
and	0
find	0
yourself	0
cheating	0
on	0
your	0
partner	1
then	0
you	0
may	0
feel	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
living	0
in	0
contradiction	0
to	0
your	0
values	1
and	0
most	0
people	0
are	0
not	0
happy	0
when	0
they	0
do	0
that	2
However	1
if	0
monogamy	0
is	0
not	0
something	0
you	0
value	1
then	0
perhaps	0
it	0
is	0
time	0
to	0
re-evaluate	0
the	0
relationship	0
and	0
determine	0
if	0
it	0
is	0
still	0
right	0
for	0
you	2
Not	0
all	0
people	0
want	0
monogamous	0
relationships	1
and	0
that	0
is	0
alright	2
Finally, if	0
you	0
value	0
your	0
husband’s	0
feelings	0
and	0
know	0
that	0
the	0
affairs	0
would	0
hurt	0
him	1
then	0
your	0
behaviors	0
may	0
again	0
be	0
in	0
contrast	0
to	0
your	0
own	0
values	2
That	0
can	0
only	0
be	0
determined	0
by	0
you	2
2.      Based	0
on	0
how	0
you	0
describe	0
your	0
relationship	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
very	0
satisfied	0
with	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
is. 	0
From	0
the	0
outside	1
it	0
looks	0
like	0
the	0
affairs	0
are	0
a	0
way	0
to	0
“get	0
even”	0
with	0
your	0
husband	0
or	0
to	0
feel	0
better	0
after	0
an	0
argument	2
This	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
can	0
happen	0
when	0
mutual	0
respect	0
starts	0
to	0
fade	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
and	0
gets	0
replaced	0
with	0
contempt	2
We	0
can	0
simply	0
stop	0
caring	0
about	0
how	0
our	0
actions	0
hurt	0
each	0
other	1
or	0
potentially	0
hurt	0
each	0
other	2
Perhaps	0
the	0
question	0
to	0
ask	0
here	0
is	1
when	0
you	0
look	0
out	0
toward	0
the	0
future	0
with	0
your	0
husband,	0
is	0
this	0
the	0
pattern	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
keep	3
The	0
pattern	0
of	0
very	0
little	0
sex,	0
argument	1
and	0
then	0
satisfying	0
the	0
pain	0
or	0
dissatisfaction	0
with	0
affairs	2
 3.      What	0
are	0
your	0

for	0
this	0
relationship	3
If	0
we	0

 In	0

you	0
can	0
always	0

 You	0

 In	0

 You	0
may	0

that	0

out	0

 But	0
in	0
terms	0
of	0
your	0
question	1
only	0
you	0
can	0

you	0
can	0
remain	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	0
in	0
which	0
you	0
defend	0
yourself	0
against	0
an	0
uncommitted	0
offense	2
One	0
of	0
the	0
first	0
steps	0
is	0
to	0
manage	0
anxiety	0
and	0
depression	0
symptoms	0
are	0
to	0
establish	0
a	0
good self-care routine. 	0
Start	0
with	0
the	0
most	0
basic	0
things:	0
Eating	0
balanced	0
meals	1
sleeping	0
at	0
from	0
6-8	0
hours	0
and	0
exercise	0
at	0
least	0
30	0
minutes	0
a	0
day. 	0
These	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
regulate	0
the	0
chemical	0
imbalance	0
that affects your	0
mood	1
plus	0
exercising	0
gives	0
you	0
time	0
to	0
vent	0
and	0
be	0
distracted	0
from	0
your	0
thoughts. 	0
Once	0
basic self-care is	0
established	1
I	0

that	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
to	0
start	0
exploring	0
the	0
source	0
of	0
these	0
feelings	1
and	0
address	0
them	0
trough	0
therapy. 	0
If	0
you	0
have	0
difficulty	0
initiating self-care routine	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0
therapist	0
about	0
what	0
motivates	0
you	0

you	0
to	0

things	1
you	0
might	0
find	0
the	0
key	0
during	0
the	0
process	2
 You	0

also	0
contact	0
your	0

before	0
entering	0

question	1

basic	2
To	0
help	0
answer	0
your	0
question	1
let	0
me	0
begin	0
with	0
the	0
premise	0
that	0
you	0
will	0
never	0
have	0
absolute	0
proof	2
With	0
that	0
being	0
said	1
one	0
can	0
look	0
at	0
different	0
phenomena	0
in	0
nature	0
and	0
history	0
and	0
figure	0
what	0
is	0
the	0
statistical	0
probability	0
that	0
they	0
happened	0
randomly	2
If	0
one	0
comes	0
to	0
the	0
logical	0
conclusion	0
that	0
many	0
are	0
quite	0
improbable	1
then	0
there	0
must	0
be	0
a	0
guiding	0
force	0
and	0
plan. 	0
May	0
you	0
be	0
successful	0
in	0
your	0
journey	2
With	0
the	0
way	0
you	0
described	0
your	0
anxiety	1
it	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
different	0
types	0
of	0
anxiety	2
I'm	0
not	0
sure	0
whether	0
you	0
have	0
anxiety	0
of	0
public	0
places	1
large	0
crowds	1
being	0
alone	0
 (sometimes	0
called	0
separation	0
anxiety)	1
or	0
some	0
combination	0
thereof.One	0
thing	0
that	0
would	0
be	0
helpful	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
track	0
your	0
anxiety	0
and	0
see	0
how	0
anxious	0
you	0
are	0
(on	0
a	0
scale	0
of	0
1	0
to	0
10)	0
in	0
different	0
situations	2
Also	1
if	0
you	0
know	0
what	0
leads	0
up	0
to	0
your	0
anxiety	1
it	0
would	0
be	0
good	0
to	0
know	0
this	0
as	0
well	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
look	0
for	0
patterns.As	0
for	0
forgetting	0
things	1
you	0
could	0
be	0
anxious	0
because	0
you	0
are	0
forgetting	0
things	0
or	0
you	0
could	0
be	0
forgetting	0
things	0
because	0
you	0
are	0
anxious	2
When	0
you	0
are	0
having	0
anxiety	1
certain	0
parts	0
of	0
your	0
brain	0
are	0
overactive	0
because	0
you	0
are	0
in	0
a	0
kind	0
of	0
protective	0
mode	2
It's	0
also	0
possible	0
that	0
forgetting	0
things	0
and	0
anxiety	0
are	0
not	0
related.Something	0
else	0
to	0
try	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
notice	0
where	0
you	0
feel	0
your	0
anxiety	0
in	0
your	0
body	0
and	0
put	0
your	0
hand	0
there	0
is	0
a	0
way	0
of	0
giving	0
yourself	0
comfort.Another	0
thing	0
about	0
anxiety	0
is	0
that	0
having	0
anxiety	0
can	0
lead	0
to	0
more	0
worry	0
about	0
having	0
more	0
anxiety	2
One	0
thing	0
that	0
helps	0
for	0
some	0
people	0
is	0
to	0
go	0
to	0
the	0
regular	0
primary	0
care	0
doctor	0
to	0
make	0

that	0

Also	1
we	0
are	0
all	0
human	0

that	0

we	0

the	0

Hi	0
Cerritos,This	0
is	0
an	0
interesting	0
twist	0

have	0
a	0
partner	0
who	0
takes	0
full	0
responsibility	0
for	0
their	0
actions. My	0
hunch	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
learned	0
some	0
things	0
about	0
yourself	0
when	0
you	0
were	0
younger	0
that	0
are	0

work	0

Forgiving	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
"it	0

Hi	0
Attica,This	0
is	0
a	0
question	0
I	0
think	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
deal	0
with...they	0
feel	0
confusion	0
about	0
why	0
they	0
can't	0
forget	0
about	0
or	0
get	0
over	0
(or	0
stop	0
connecting	0
with)	0
someone	0
who	0
they	0
absolutely	0
know	0
isn't	0
good	0
for	0
them. In	0
your	0
case	1
part	0
of	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
that	0
he	0
keeps	0
trying	0
to	0
get	0
back	0
in	0
touch	0
with	0
you	2
For	0
some	0
people	1
honestly	1
it's	0
a	0
game..	2
to	0
see	0
how	0
much	0
power	0
they	0
have	0
over	0
you	0
or	0
it's	0
their	0
need	0
to	0
control	0
you	2
If	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
contact	0
from	0
this	0
person	1
it's	0
really	0
important	0
to	0
give	0
him	0
clear	0
messages	0
about	0
boundaries	0
("Don't	0
contact	0
me	0
again")	1
and	0
then	0
ignore	0
all	0
of	0
their	0
communications	2
Any	0
interactions	0
or	0
responses	0
from	0
you	0
at	0
all	0
will	0
feed	0
their	0
behaviour	2
Remind	0
yourself	0
why	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
be	0
with	0
them	2
I	0
hear	0
you	0
doing	0
that	0
already	0
when	0
you	0
say	0
"he	0
has	0
nothing	0
to	0
offer	0
me"	2
That's	0
great	0
self-talk.But	0
let's	0
get	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
question	0
of	0
why	0
we	0
have	0
a	0
hard	0
time	0
letting	0
go	0
of	0
people	0
like	0
this	2
Sometimes	0
it's	0
because	0
we	0
still	0
hope	0
they	0
will	0
change	2
Maybe	0
we	0
remember	0
who	0
they	0
used	0
to	0
be	0
or	0
how	0
they	0
used	0
to	0
treat	0
us	1
and	0
we	0
think	0
it	0
can	0
go	0
back	0
to	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
felt	0
in	0
those	0
"good	0
old	0
days"	2
The	0
problem	0
there	0
is	0
that	1
over	0
the	0
first	0
few	0
years	1
as	0
intimacy	0
grows	1
people	0
tend	0
to	0
show	0
more	0
of	0
who	0
they	0
are	1
not	0
less	2
So	0
what	0
they're	0
eventually	0
showing	0
you	0
is	0
who	0
they	0
are	0
and	0
what	0
they're	0
capable	0
of	2
People	0
do	0
change	0
and	0
grow	1
but	0
it	0
won't	0
happen	0
at	0
your	0
pace	2
Accept	0
that	0
person	0
for	0
who	0
they	0
are	0
and	0
stop	0
expecting	0
them	0
to	0
change. Another	0
reason	0
we	0
can't	0
let	0
go	0
is	0
because	0
we	0
picture	0
our	0
ex	0
with	0
someone	0
new	0
in	0
the	0
future	0
and	0
we	0
wonder	0
if	0
they	0
will	0
be	0
a	0
better	0
person	0
for	0
the	0
next	0
partner	0
in	0
their	0
life	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
normal..	2
but	0
not	0
a	0
healthy..	2
thought	2
It's	0
as	0
though	0
we	0
want	0
them	0
to	0
stay	1
maybe	0
apologize	1
and	0
heal	0
our	0
hurts;	0
maybe	0
make	0
up	0
for	0
past	0
mistakes	2
You	0
deserve	0
that	0
healing	1
you	0
deserve	0
better	0
than	0
you	0
got	1
you	0
deserve	0
apologies	1
but	0
to	0
expect	0
that	0
from	0
the	0
person	0
who	0
hurt	0
you	0
and	0
hasn't	0
demonstrated	0
that	0
compassion	0
as	0
yet	0
is	0
probably	0
foolhardy. It	0
is	0
my	0
belief	0
that	0
underlying	0
some	0
of	0
the	0
above	0
scenarios	0
is	0
the	0
deep	0
belief	0
that	0
we	0
must	0
somehow	0
be	0
responsible	0
for	0
the	0
hurts	0
our	0
exes	0
have	0
caused	2
If	0
you	0
blame	0
yourself	0
in	0
any	0
way	0
for	0
someone's	0
poor	0
treatment	0
of	0
you	1
you	0
will	0
be	0
dancing	0
around	0
trying	0
to	0
do	0
things	0
differently	0
so	0
that	0
they	0
can	0
treat	0
you	0
better	2
It	0
will	0
be	0
impossible	0
to	0
let	0
go	1
because	0
you	0
blame	0
yourself	0
for	0
their	0
behaviours.Draw	0
a	0
line	2
Their	0
behaviours	0
are	0
about	0
them	1
not	0
you	1
and	0
the	0
only	0
solution	0
is	0
to	0
challenge	0
and	0
reduce	0
thoughts	0
of	0
them	1
and	0
create	0
physical	0
and	0
emotional	0
distance	2

it	0

you'd	0
be	0

if	0
you	0

how	0
many	0
people	0
feel	0
the	0

Being	0
in	0
crowds	0
can	0
provoke	0
anxiety	0
(one	0
of	0
the	0
symptoms	0
of	0
anxiety	0
is	0
irritability	0
or	0
anger	1
like	0
you	0
described). 	0
For	0
some	0
people	1
that's	0
just	0
because	0
of	0
their	0
personality	0
(if	0
you	0
tend	0
to	0
be	0
more	0
introverted	1
being	0
around	0
lot	0
of	0
people	0
is	0
really	0
draining). 	0
For	0
others	1
it	0
can	0
point	0
to	0
a	0
diagnosis	0
of	0
social	0
anxiety.I'd	0
recommend	0
starting	0
by	0
writing	0
down	0
your	0
self-talk. 	0
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
are	0
telling	0
yourself	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
negative	0
messages	0
(as	0
you	0
mentioned	1
having	0
imaginary	0
conversations	0
and	0
assuming	0
people	0
are	0
judging	0
you). 	0
Write	0
down	0
the	0
thoughts	0
that	0
are	0
leading	0
to	0
you	0
feeling	0
terrible	0
and	0
crying. 	0
Maybe	0
that's: 	0
I'm	0
stupid	1
Everyone	0
else	0
is	0
having	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
so	0
I	0
should	0
be	0
too	1
There's	0
something	0
wrong	0
with	0
me. 	0
Just	0
writing	0
these	0
down	0
is	0
an	0
important	0
starting	0
point	0
because	0
it	0
allows	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
objective	0
to	0
your	0
thoughts. 	0
When	0
you	0
see	0
them	0
on	0
paper	1
you	0
can	0
start	0
to	0
identify	0
the	0
lies	0
and	0
reframe	0
them. 	0
Next	0
to	0
your	0
negative	0
thoughts	1
write	0
some	0
positives: 	0
I	0
have	0
something	0
to	0

The	0

the	0

(an	0

to	0

the	0

from	0
insurance	1
the	0
next	0
place	0
that	0

option	0
might	0

to	0

It	0
sounds	0

sounds	0
as	0
if	0
sometimes	0
your	0

want	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
part	0
of	0
his	0
life	0
(which	0
could	0

a	0
part	0
of	0
where	0
the	0

comes	0
from)	0
and	0
sometimes	0
he	0
doesn't	2
Talking	0
about	0
this	0
would	0
likely	0
be	0
a	0
delicate	0
conversation	0
and	0
from	0
what	0
you	0
mention	0
he	0
has	0
been	0
diagnosed	0
with	1
I'm	0
wondering	0
if	0
he	0
has	0
a	0
therapist	2
If	0
so	1
do	0
you	0
know	0
whether	0
he	0
would	0
allow	0
you	0
to	0
come	0
to	0
one	0
session	0
so	0
you	0
can	0
learn	0
more	0
about	0
how	0
he	0
feels	3
Maybe	0
he	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
use	0
more	0
of	0
it	0
because	0
in	0
the	0
contained	0
environment	0
of	0
an	0
therapy	0
office	2
This	0
way	0
at	0
least	0
you	0
would	0
know	0
where	0
he's	0
coming	0
from	2
You	0
could	0
also	0
ask	0
whether	0
he	0
is	0
able	0
to	0
hear	0
what	0
you	0
want	1
wish	0
for	1
or	0
desire	0
between	0
the	0
two	0
of	0
you.Remember	1
just	0
because	0
you	0
hear	0
or	0
follow	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
saying	0
does	0
not	0
imply	0
that	0
you	0
agree	0
with	0
him	1
although	0
that	0
concept	0
in	0
itself	0
could	0
be	0
a	0
subject	0
of	0
discussion	0
because	0
not	0
everyone	0
is	0
aware	0
of	0
it.I	0
hope	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
hold	0
onto	0
who	0
you	0
are	0

what	0
you	0
want	0
throughout	0
this	2
Hi	0
there	2
It's	0
great	0
you	0
are	0
able	0
to	0
realize	0
there	0
are	0
other	0
issues	0
going	0
on	0
with	0
someone	0
who	0
feels	0
possessive	2
At	0
the	0
root	0
of	0
it	0
is	0
fear	2
Fear	0
of	0
losing	0
someone	1
fear	0
of	0
being	0
alone	1
fear	0
of	0
not	0
being	0
good	0
enough	2
All	0
those	0
fears	0
can	0
lead	0
to	0
low	0
self-esteem	0
and	0
feeling	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
to	0
control	0
other	0
people	0
so	0
you	0
don't	0

them	2
The	0
thing	0
is	1
controlling	0
other	0
people	0
only	0
pushes	0
them	0
away	2
Vicious	0
circle	1
right? What	0
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
is	0
some	0
cognitive	0
therapy	0
to	0
change	0
those	0
underlying	0
ways	0
of	0
thinking	2
You	0
can	0
start	0
with	0
this	0
assignment	2
Write	0
down	0
all	0
the	0
things	0
you	0
think	0
about	0
yourself	1
positive	0
and	0
not-so-positive	2
Then	0
rewrite	0
those	0
not-so-positive	0
things	0
so	0
they	0
are	0
positive	2
For	0
example	1
thinking	0
something	0
like	1
"I'm	0
too	0
pushy"	1
can	0
be	0
rewritten	0
as	1
"I'm	0
assertive	0
and	0
I	0
go	0
after	0
what	0
I	0
want."	0
It	0
can	0
be	0
hard	0
to	0
do	0
since	0
we	0
tend	0
to	0
get	0
"stuck"	0
in	0
our	0
negative	0
ways	0
of	0
thinking	0
about	0
ourselves	2
If	0
you	0
have	0
someone	0
you	0
trust	1
you	0
can	0
ask	0
for	0
their	0
help	0
as	0
well	0
since	0
most	0
likely	0

you	0

this	0

a	0

Here	0
are	0

A	0
person	0
may	0
have	0

either	0
when	0

that	0

for	0

reason	0
for	0

everyone	2
If	0
the	0
right	0
level	0
of	0

not	0
happening	1
the	0
counselor	0
will	0
often	0
look	0
first	0
at	0
what	0
they	0
are	0
doing	1
might	0
talk	0
about	0
it	0

working	0

A	0
similar	0
process	0

be	0
followed	0
if	0

that	0

yet	0

between	0

up	0

situation	0
to	0

when	0

nothing	0

While	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
easiest	0
one	0
to	0
determine	1
it	0

also	0
probably	0
the	0
hardest	0
one	0
for	0
the	0

the	0

in	0
not	0
wanting	0
the	0

to	0
an	0
end	2
However	1
counselors	0
know	0
that	0
this	0
is	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
process	2
They	0
will	0
also	0
determine	0
this	0
by	0
regularly	0
reviewing	0
the	0

by	0
sending	0
in	0
the	0

of	0

of	0

coming	0

going	0
or	0
currently	0
living	0
in	0
the	0
home	1
my	0
suggestion	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
is	0
to	0
pack	0
a	0
bag	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
and	0
go	0
somewhere	0
safe	0
(i.e	2
family	0
members	0
home	1
friend	0
or	0
a	0
shelter	0
temporarily)	2
I	0
cannot	0
stress	0
this	0
enough	2
Although	1
some	0
people	0
tend	0
to	0
minimize	0
their	0
abusers	0
behavior	0
(i.e	2
they	0
only	0
do	0
it	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
drinking	1
they	0
only	0
do	0
it	0
when	0
they	0
are	0
mad)	1
it’s	0
those	0
individuals	0
that	0
find	0
themselves	0
or	0
their	0
children	0
in	0
a	0
serious	0
situation	2
So	1
you	0
can	0
never	0
take	0
abuse	0
(physical	0
or	0
mental)	0
lightly	0
because	0
you	0
never	0
know	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
through	0
that	0
persons	0
mind	0
at	0
that	0
particular	0
time	2
It’s	0
always	0
better	0
to	0
be	0
safe	0
than	0
sorry. Secondly	1
it	0
will	0
not	0
be	0
safe	1
helpful	0
or	0
productive	0
to	0
attempt	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
the	0
abuser	0
about	0
your	0
relationship	2
Abusers	0
often	0
times	0
try	0
and	0
manipulate	0
you	0
into	0
staying	0
by	0
apologizing	0
or	0
attempting	0
to	0
justify	0
their	0
behaviors	2
This	0
is	0
the	0
time	0
you	0
would	0
want	0
to	0
go	0
see	0
a	0
magistrate	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
protective	0
order	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children.It’s	0
unfortunate	0
that	0
your	0
significant	0
other	0
was	0
involved	0
with	0
another	0
women	0
causing	0
pregnancy;	0
however	1
that	0
is	0
no	0
longer	0
your	0
concern	2
Your	0
concern	0
at	0
this	0
point	0
is	0
keeping	0
yourself	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
safe	2
I	0
would	0
also	0
suggest	0
counseling	0
for	0
you	0
and	0
your	0
children	0
in	0
order	0
to	0
work	0
through	0
these	0
issues	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
was	0
helpful	0
and	0
please	0
stay	0
safe	0
and	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	2
This	0
sounds	0
very	0

for	0
you.Are	0
you	0
able	0
to	0
tell	0

enough	0

and	0
maybe	0
he	0
does.Long	0

if	0

this	0
then	0
usually	0
people	0
feel	0
they	0
have	0
two	0
choices	1
put	0
up	0
with	0
it	1
which	0
of	0

greatly	0
reduces	0
the	0
sense	0
of	0
satisfaction	0
in	0
the	0

 	0

of	0

you	0
can	0

the	0

 This	0

is	0
quite	0

now	0
that	0

Hi!	0
Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0
question	2
It's	0
tough	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
a	0
healthy	0
and	0
loving	0
relationship	0
when	0
we	0
believe	0
we	0
are	0
not	0
worth	0
it	2
Quite	0
often	0
being	0
in	0
such	0
a	0
relationship	0
is	0
very	0
uncomfortable	0
as	0
it	0
goes	0
against	0
everything	0
we	0
believe	0
about	0
ourselves. First	1
I	0
want	0
to	0
say	0
you	0
are	0
very	0
brave	0
to	0
open	0
up	0
yourself	0
to	0
the	0
relationship	0

this	0
wonderful	0
woman	0
you	0
met. Second	1
I	0

something	0
new	0

totally	0
unfamiliar	0

scary	1
so	0
it's	0
vital	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
kind	0
and	0
gentle	0
with	0
yourself	2
Acknowledge	0
that	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
doing	0
is	0
scary	0
and	0
uncomfortable	0
and	0
that	0
it	0
will	0
take	0
some	0
time	0
to	0
get	0
used	0
to	0
it. Don't	0
judge	0
yourself	0
and	0
force	0
yourself	0
to	0
feel	0
a	0
certain	0
way	2

My	0
answer	0
is	0
this:	0
sometimes	2
Many	0
people	0
benefit	0
from	0
counseling	0
and	0
when	0
counseling	0
works	0
those	0
benefits	0
can	0
show	0
up	0
through	0
positive	0
improvements	0
in	0
your	0
moods	1
making	0
more	0
choices	0
that	0
align	0
with	0
your	0

working	0
through	0

a	0

approach	0
they	0

up	0
and	0
when	0
that	0
happens	0
sometimes	0
counseling	0

not	0

It	0
is	0
very	0
important	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
right	0
counselor	0
for	0
you	2
Ideally	0
this	0
should	0
be	0
someone	0
you	0

I	0

Sherry	0
that	0

These	0
questions	0
help	0
couples	0
to	0

if	0

If	0
your	0

responds	0
in	0
an	0
open	0

it	0
usually	0
indicates	0
that	0

your	0
importance	2
If	0
he	0
responds	0
in	0

it	0

your	0

Either	0

that	2
If	0

Hi	0
Campbell	0
River, You	0
say	0
you	0
have	0
anger	0
but	0
you	0
don't	0
mention	0
how	0
it	0
shows	2
Or	0
maybe	0
it	0
doesn't	2
Are	0
you	0
aggressive	0
with	0
your	0
girlfriend	3
Since	0
you	0
mention	0
depression	1
I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you're	0
bottling	0
it	0
all	0
up	0
somewhere	0
instead	0
of	0
letting	0
it	0
show	0
at	0
all	2
If	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
case	1
I	0
admire	0
your	0
ability	0
to	0
not	0
lash	0
out	0
at	0
someone	0
who's	0
hurting	0
you	2
However	1
if	0
they	0
are	0
totally	0
 unexpressed	1
anger	0
turn	0
inward	0
and	0
shift	0
into	0
depression	2
When	0
she yells	0
at	0
you	1
what	0
do	0
you	0
do	3
Is	0
this	0
the	0
moment	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
the	0
most	0
angry	3
I	0
wouldn't	0
be	0
surprised;	0
anger	0
is	0
a	0
normal	0
response	0
to	0
someone	0
yelling	0
at	0
you. Something	0
about	0
anger...it's	0
often	0
there	0
to	0
cover	0
up	0
our	0
more	0
vulnerable	0
emotions	2
Under	0
the	0
anger	0
I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
worthless	1
powerless	1
scared	1
unloved	2
Part	0
of	0
the	0
trick	0
to	0
reducing	0
anger	0
is	0
identifying	0
those	0
other	0
emotions	0

expressing	0
them. You	0

What	0
I	0

the	0

there	0

nothing	0
we	0
can	0
do	0
to	0

them	1
but	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
offer	0
two	0
techniques	0
that	0
might	0
assist	0
with	0
your	0
panic	0
&	0
anxiety. The	0
first	0
step	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
scary	0
or	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
is	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
just	0
thoughts	0
and	0
we	0
can	0
choose	0
to	0
follow	0
the	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	0
or	0
work	0
with	0
cutting	0
them	0
off	0
or	0
ignoring	0
them	2
I	0
also	0
realize	0
that	0
might	0
seem	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
do	1
but	0
here's	0
a	0
good	0
way	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
brain	0
and	0
how	0
thought	0
patterns	0
work	2
Thoughts	0
arise	0
in	0
the	0
mind	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
our	0
brain	0
is	0
a	0
thought	0
machine	2
Many	0
thoughts	0
drift	0
by	0
like	0
clouds	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	0
while	0
other	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
and	0
they	0
trigger	0
us	0
in	0
a	0
particulate	0
way	1
i.e.	1
scary	1
angry	1
happy	1
sad	1
and	0
when	0
those	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
we	0
can	0
chose	0
to	0
pay	0
more	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
which	0
can	0
lead	0
us	0
down	0
that	0
particular	0
thought	0
stream	0
that	0
will	0
lead	0
to	0
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	2
So	1
how	0
do	0
we	0
work	0
or	0
stop	0
those	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	3
One	0
new	0
skill	0
to	0
implement	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
work	0
of	0
Rick	0
Hansen	1
he	0
wrote	0
the	0
book	0
Buddha's	0
Brain,"	0
he	0
teaches	0
that	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
give	0
more	0
energy	0
and	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
positive	0
thoughts	0
or	0
positive	0
memories	0
we	0
hold	0
in	0
our	0
mind	0
and	0
pay	0
less	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	2
Hansen	0
asks	0
us	0
to	0
imagine	0
the	0
brain	0
this	0
way	1
the	0
brain	0
is	0
like	0
Velcro	0
with	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
and	0
like	0
teflon	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
positive	0
thoughts	2
There	0
are	0
reasons	0
that	0
our	0
brain	0
works	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
I	0
don't	0
have	0
time	0
to	0
go	0
into	0
all	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
this	0
response	2
So	1
it's	0
just	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
positive	0
thinking	1
actually	0
pausing	0
throughout	0
the	0
day	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
positive	0
feelings	0
and	0
memories	1
 this	0
will	0
help	0
the	0
mind	0
reinforce	0
positive	0
thought	0
streams	0
and	0
help	0
reduce	0
negative	0
thought	0
streams	0
over	0
time	2
If	0
a	0
scary	0
thought	0
arises	0
try	0
to	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
a	0
happy	0
experience	0
for	0
at	0
least	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
moments	1
and	0
see	0
if	0
that	0
helps	0
reduce	0
the	0
negative	0
charge	0
connected	0
with	0
that	0
scary	0
thought. I	0
would	0
also	0
suggest	0
when	0
you're	0
having	0
the	0
thoughts	0
about	0
death	0
take	0
a	0
moment	0
to	0
notice	0
how	0
you're	0
breathing	2
Often	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
feeling	0
anxiety	0
we	0
are	0
doing	0
shallowing	0

than	0
taking	0
in	0
a	0
full	1
deep	0
breath	0
or	0
what	0
is	0
called	0

breathing	2
If	0
you	0
take	0
a	0

to	0
focus	0
on	0
your	0
breathing	0
and	0
allow	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
full	0
breaths	1
bringing	0
in	0
the	0
breath	0
so	0
the	0
belly	0
rises	0
and	0
then	0
the	0

natural	0
falls	0
as	0
you	0
exhale	1
just	0
noticing	0
the	0
breath	0
and	0
practicing	0

slow	0
down	0

The	0
only	0
time	0
an	0

Hello	2
So	1
someone	0

you	0

is	0
no	0

around	3
I	0
am	0
sure	0
that	0
feels	0
devastating	2
As	0
a	0
counselor	0
I	0
usually	0
have	0
to	0
ponder	0
this	0
kind	0
of	0
thought	0
because	0
it	0
lends	0
itself	0
to	0
suggesting	0
that	0
happiness	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
external	1
rather	0
than	0
the	0
internal	0
side	0
of	0
a	0
person's	0
life	2
Happiness	0
is	0
formed	0
within	0
ourselves	2
All	0
the	0
external	0
trappings	0
of	0
happiness	0
are	0
usually	0
quite	0
fleeting	1
and	0
temporary	2
Even	0
relationships	0

not	0

If	0
we	0

to	0
a	0

we	0
are	0
reliant	0
and	0
dependent	0
on	0
those	0
around	0
us	0
to	0
create	0
happiness	0
in	0
our	0
lives	1
then	0
we	0
lose	0
the	0
opportunities	0
for	0
us	0
to	0
do	0
it	0
ourselves	2
We	0
are	0
entirely	0
capable	0
of	0
finding	0
ways	0
to	0
be	0
happy	2
Sometimes	0
this	0
entails	0
working	0
out	0
issues	0
that	0
are	0
holding	0
us	0
back	0
from	0
reaching	0
a	0
place	0
of	0
peace	1

resolution	0
to	0
a	0
specific	0
problem.What	0
I	0
would	0

to	0

to	0

ways	0

Mourning	0
the	0

of	0
a	0

(in	0

Hello	1

that	0
your	0

no	0

cares	0
less	0
for	0
you	1
especially	0
if	0
your	0

not	0
changed	2
It	0
can	0
be	0
scary	1
frustrating	1
and	0
lonely	2
Have	0
you	0
tried	0
talking	0
to	0
him	0
about	0
your	0
concerns	3
I	0
would	0
suggest	0
to	0
start	0
there	2
There	0
may	0
be	0
several	0
reasons	0
for	0
his	0
actions	1
some	0
of	0
which	0
may	0
have	0
nothing	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
how	0
he	0
feels	0
for	0
you. Learning	0
about	0
what	0
is	0
going	0

for	0
him	0
will	0
likely	0
answer	0
your	0
questions	0

depending	0
on	0
his	0
response	1
may cause	0
some	0
relief	2
When initiating	0
conversations	0
about	0
subjects	0
that	0
are	0
sensitive	1
there	0
are	0
a	0
few	0
things	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
remember. Tell	0
him	0
how	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
are	0
experiencing	1
rather	0
than	0
blaming	0
him	0
or	0
telling	0
him	0
what	0
he	0
is	0
doing	0
wrong	2
Avoid using	0
extreme	1
black	0
and	0
white	0
language	0
(i.e	2
always	0
and	0
never). For	0
example	1
you	0
may	0
say	0
something	0
such	0
as	1
"I	0
feel	0
confused	0
that	0
we	0
are	0
rarely	0
intimate	0
and	0
I'm	0
wondering	0
if	0
you've	0
also	0
noticed	0
this	0
change"	0
versus	0
"You	0
are	0
never	0
intimate	0
with	0
me	0
anymore." Don't	0
be	0
afraid	0
to	0
ask	0
him	0
questions	2
You	0
deserve	0
to	0
know	0
what	0
is	0
going	0
on	1
as	0
his	0
behavior	0
is	0
effecting	0
your	0
well	0
being	2
I	0
like	0
to	0
ask	0
open-ended	0
questions	0
instead	0
of	0
yes	0
and	0
no	0
questions	2
It	0
allows	0
for more	0
clarity	0
and	0
deeper explanation	2
Lastly, ask	0
yourself	0
(and	0
possibly	0
him)	0
what	0
part	0
you	0
play	0
in	0
the	0
recent	0
changes	2
Does	0
he	0
feel	0
that	0
you've	0

Does	0

out	0

Some	0
parents	0

everything	0

Another	0
question	0
I	0

for	0

what	0
would	0

find	0
out	0
what	0
motivates	0
his	0
behavior	3
Discovering	0
the	0
roots	0
of	0
such	0
behavior	0

something	0
that	0
he	0
would	0
have	0
to	0

on	0
in	0
his	0

not	0
something	0

with	0

It's	0
not	0
the	0
only	0
type	0
of	0
therapy	0
that	0

it	0

realistic	2
As	0
Cory	0
mentioned	1
anxiety	0
is	0
something	0
that	0

so	0
therapies	0
that	0
indicate	0
we	0
can	0
get	0
rid	0
of	0
it	0
are	0
questionable	2
Our	0
natural	0
inclination	0
when	0
we	0
have	0
anxiety	0
is	0
to	0
STOP	0
any	0
and	0
all	0
things	0
that	0
may	0
cause	0
it	0

provoke	0
it	2

do	0
this	0

it	0

it	0
actually	0
doesn't	2

Hi	0
Troy	1
I	0
totally	0
get	0
this	2
It's	0
a	0
dilemma;	0
you	0
want	0
your	0
dad	0
to	0
know	0
how	0
he's	0
hurting	0
you	0
but	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
safe	0
enough	0
to	0
say	0
anything	0
to	0
him	2
Your	0
reaction	0
is	0
understandable;	0
it's	0
his	0
responsibility	0
as	0
a	0
parent	0
to	0
work	0
harder	0
than	0
you	0
to	0
create	0
that	0
safe	0
place	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
open	2
But	0
that's	0
not	0
who	0
your	0
dad	0
is	2
Your	0
dad	0
is	0
your	0
dad	1
and	0
waiting	0
for	0
him	0
to	0
change	0
won't	0
really	0
help	2
Nothing	0
you	0
do	0
can	0
change	0
your	0
dad	1
but...there	0
are	0
things	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
for	0
yourself	0
and	0
your	0
relationship	0
with	0
him. While	0
your	0
response	0
of	0
avoiding	0
him	0
is	0
understandable	1
I	0
wonder	0
what	0
effect	0
it	0
has	0

It's	0

that	0
he's	0

but	0
he	0
probably	0
doesn't	2
So	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
squirrel	0
chasing	0
its	0
tail:	0
your	0
dad	0
is	0
rude	1
so	0
your	0
habit	0
is	0
to	0
be	0
silent	1
then	0
he	0
maybe	0
feels	0
abandoned	0
and	0
frustrated	2
His	0
frustration	0
comes	0
out	0
as	0
more	0
rudeness	1
which	0
makes	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
withdraw	0
more	1
and	0
the	0
cycle	0
starts	0
all	0
over	0
again	2
You	0
can't	0

his	0

you	0

yours.Are	0
you	0

Can	0
you	0

honest	0
about	0
how	0
you're	0

What's	0
the	0
worst	0
thing	0
that	0

you're	0

If	0

a	0

worry	0
your	0

you	1
maybe	0
give	0
honesty	0
a	0

point	0

that	1
as	0
rude	0
as	0
your	0
dad	0
may	0
be	1
checking	0
out	0
of	0
a	0

Hello	2
Usually	0
the	0
person	0
interested	0

reaches	0
out	0
to	0
the	0
therapist	1
by	0
telephone	0

email	2
 I	0
like	0
to	0
respond	0
with	0
appreciation	0
for	0
their	0
making	0

phone	0
consultation	0
in	0
order	0

see	0
how	0
I	0
may	0

 Once	0
we	0
are	0
on	0
the	0
phone	1
I	0
like	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
brief	0
sense	0
of	0
what's	0
happening	0
in	0
their	0
life	0
and	0
the	0
way	0
in	0
which	0
I	0
respond	0
and	0
the	0
way	0
we	0
communicate	0
will	0
give	0
each	0

a	0
sense	0

whether	0
our	0
dynamic	0
is	0
appealing	0
enough	0
to	0
take	0
the	0
next	0
step	2
 And	0
the	0
next	0
step	0
is	0
making	0
an	0
appointment	2
 Also	0
in	0
the	0
initial	0
conversation	1
you	0
can	0
feel	0
free	0
to	0
ask	0
what	0
their	0
therapeutic	0
modality	0
is	0
or	0
give	0
a	0
brief	0
scenario	0
and	0
ask	0
how	0
the	0
therapist	0
might	0
respond	0
to	0
that	0
situation	2
 I	0
encourage	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
fearless	0
in	0
"interviewing"	0
the	0
therapist	2
 This	0
is	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
most	0
sacred	0
connections	0
of	0
trust	0
you	0
could	0
be	0
about	0
to	0
forge	1
so	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
comfortable	1
move	0
on	0
to	0
the	0
next	0
therapist	0
on	0
your	0
list	2
 If	0
the	0
connection	0
feels	0
good	0
to	0
you	1
then	0
it's	0
worth	0
it	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
first	0
appointment	2
 You	0
will	0
immediately	0
know	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
feel	0
comfortable	0
speaking	0

this	0

encourage	0
you	0
to	0
make	0
the	0
appointment	2
 Once	0
you're	0
in	0
the	0
first	0
session	1
you	0
can	0

your	0

just	0
how	0

keep	0

yourself	0
every	0

of	0
the	0
way!	0
This	0
seems	0
like	0
two	0
questions	2

first	0
is	0
what	0
may	0
have	0
happened	0
to	0
prompt	0
him	0
to	0
back	0
off	2
 The	0
second	0
is	0
what	0
it	0
means	0
to	0
you	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
boyfriend	0
who	0
takes	0
anti-depression	0
medication	0
who	0
says	0
he	0
has	0
"a	0
lot	0
on	0
his	0
mind."	0
 Both	0
give	0
you	0
opportunity	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
yourself	2
 Having	0
expectations	0
can	0
be	0
a	0
huge	0
trap	2

do	0

who	0
is	0
more	0
in	0

with	0

wants	0
for	0
your	0

out	0
you	0

okay!	0
Let	0

Hi	0
California	1
What	0
you're	0
experiencing	0
is	0
indeed	0
anxiety;	0
it's	0
very	0
common	2
Through	0
research	0
we	0
know	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	0
about	0
how	0
to	0
reduce	0
anxiety	2
I'll	0
get	0
you	0
started	0
and	0
it's	0
a	0
great	0
idea	0
to	0
connect	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
can	0
build	0
on	0
these	0
ideas	0
and	0
get	0
to	0
know	0
you	0
well.It's	0
natural	0
to	0
have	0
random	0
thoughts	0
that	0
unsettle	0
us	2
Our	0
brains	0
are	0
complex	1
wonderful	0
things	2
Fearful	0
and	0
anxious	0
thoughts	0
are	0
a	0
part	0
of	0
this	0
picture;	0
their	0
purpose	0
is	0
to	0
prepare	0
us	0
for	0
the	0
future	0
and	0
to	0
help	0
us	0
make	0
sense	0
of	0
the	0
past	0
and	0
learn	0
from	0
it	2
But	0
what	0
happens	0
sometimes	0
is	0
that	0
our	0
alarm	0
systems	0
get	0
out	0
of	0
whack	0
and	0
get	0
set	0
off	0
too	0
easily	2
We	0
often	0
spend	0
TOO	0
MUCH	0
time	0
worrying	0
about	0
things	0
that	0
happened	0
or	0
might	0
happen	2
When	0
these	0
thoughts	0
take	0
away	0
from	0
our	0
enjoyment	0
of	0
life	1
it	0
becomes	0
a	0
problem	2
So	1
while	0
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	0
try	0
to	0
protect	0
us	1
they	0
also	0
seek	0
power	0
and	0
will	0
take	0
any	0
power	0
they	0
can	0
get.In	0
general	1
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	0
try	0
to	0
tell	0
us	0
one	0
or	0
both	0
of	0
two	0
things:	0
that	0
something	0
is	0
wrong	0
with	0
us	1
or	0
that	0
something	0
bad	0
will	0
happen	0
(or	0
that	0
something	0
bad	0
will	0
happen	0
because	0
there's	0
something	0
wrong	0
with	0
us)	2
They	0
will	0
use	0
anything	0
they	0
can	0
as	0
evidence	0
to	0
convince	0
you	2
For	0
example..	2
"That	0
person	0
looked	0
at	0
you	0
funny	2
You're	0
strange	0
looking"	2
Well	0
there	0
are	0
dozens	0
of	0
possible	0
explanations	0
for	0
the	0
look	0
on	0
that	0
person's	0
face	1
and	0
it's	0
unlikely	0
it	0
had	0
anything	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
you. For	0
you	0
personally	1
your	0
thoughts	0
are	0
about	0
the	0
afterlife...about	0
living	0
forever	2
What	0
does	0
fear	0
tell	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
uncomfortable	0
about	0
living	0
forever	3
What	0
would	0
the	0
worst	0
part	0
be	3
A	0
therapist	0
would	0
help	0
you	0
dig	0
deep	0
to	0
find	0
the	0
core	0
of	0
what	0
you	0
fear	2
It	0
might	0
be	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
no	0
control	0
over	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
or	0
where	0
you	0
go	2
It	0
might	0
be	0
that	0
you	0
fear	0
going	0
to	0
hell	0
because	0
you're	0
"bad"	2
Search	0
for	0
that	0
deepest	0
fear.I	0
invite	0
you	0
then	0
to	0
picture	0
that	0
thought	0
as	0
a	0
glass	0
of	0
water	0
on	0
a	0
shelf	2
It's	0
a	0
heavy	0
glass	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
held	0
it	0
in	0
your	0
hands	0
for	0
a	0
while	0
and	0
stared	0
at	0
it	1
it	0
would	0
get	0
in	0
the	0
way;	0
you'd	0
be	0
uncomfortable	0
and	0
unable	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
your	0
life	2
That's	0
what's	0
happening	0
now	2
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
the	0
problem	0
is	0
not	0
so	0
much	0
the	0
thought	0
you're	0
having;	0
we	0
all	0
have	0
random	0
silly	0
thoughts	0
that	0
usually	0
aren't	0
true	2
The	0
problem	0
is	0
how	0
long	0
you're	0
holding	0
it	0
in	0
your	0
hand	2
You	0
could	0
have	0
that	0
thought	0
(pick	0
up	0
that	0
glass)	0
a	0
hundred	0
times	0
a	0
day	0
and	1
as	0
long	0
as	0
you	0
put	0
it	0
right	0
back	0
on	0
the	0
shelf	1
it's	0
not	0
a	0
problem	2
The	0
trick	0
is	0
to	0
get	0
it	0
back	0
on	0
that	0
shelf.Right	0
now	1
you're	0
using	0
distraction	0
to	0
do	0
this	2
You're	0
trying	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
other	0
things	0
around	0
you	1
but	0
I	0
think	0
the	0
glass	0
is	0
still	0
in	0
your	0
hand	2
It's	0
not	0
enough;	0
you're	0
looking	0
for	0
more	0
tools	0
to	0
get	0
that	0
glass	0
back	0
on	0
the	0
shelf	2
 And	0
the	0
key	0
is	0
in	0
your	0
thoughts	2
Once	0
you	0
find	0
out	0
what	0
fear	0
is	0
trying	0
to	0
tell	0
you	1
then	0
you	0
can	0
"talk	0
back	0
to"	0
fear	2
So	1
as	0
an	0
example	1
if	0
fear	0
is	0
saying	0
to	0
you	0
"you	0
have	0
no	0
control	0
over	0
anything"	1
then	0
you	0
can	0
work	0
to	0
accept	0
the	0
pieces	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
control	0
over	1
learn	0
to	0
tolerate	0
that	0
feeling	1
and	0
claim	0
back	0
the	0
pieces	0
you	0
CAN	0
control	2
You	0
CAN	0
control	0
the	0
extent	0
to	0
which	0
you	0
let	0
fear	0
take	0
you	0
over. With	0
a	0
therapist	0
you	0
can	0
learn	0
to	0
"refute"	0
fears'	0
ideas	2
You	0
can	0
learn	0
to	0
look	0
for	0
concrete	0
evidence	0
of	0
fear's	0
lies	0
and	0
gain	0
back	0
control	0
over	0
your	0
thoughts	2
I	0
wish	0
you	0
the	0
best!	0
It	0
sounds	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
feeling	0
pretty	0
down	1
since	0
the	0
loss	0
of	0
a	0
relationship	1
and	0
you're	0
wondering	0
how	0
to	0
be	0
happy	0
by	0
yourself	2
Intimacy	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
natural	0
human	0
desire	0
and	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
learning	0
to	0
enjoy	0
ourselves	1
even	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
alone	1
can	0
strengthen	0
our	0
ability	0
to	0
lead	0
a	0
satisfying	0
life	0
in	0
and	0
out	0
of	0
relationship	2
Working	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	1
you	0
may	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
gain	0
insight	0
into	0
how	0
you	0
show	0
up	0
in	0
your	0
relationships	0
with	0
yourself	0
and	0
others	0
and	0
discover	0
more	0
fulfilling	0
ways	0
to	0
do	0
so	2
Depending	0
on	0
your	0
area	0
and	0
location	1
there	0
may	0
be	0
therapists	0
who	0
provide	0
services	0
on	0
a	0
sliding	0
scale	2
Additionally	1
churches	0
will	0
often	0
times offer	0
counseling	0
for	0
free	0
or	0
for	0
a	0
small	0
fee	2
I	0
suggest	0
doing	0
a	0
simple	0
Google	0
search	0
and	0
contact	0
therapists	0
in	0
your	0
area	2
It	0
never	0
hurts	0

Hello!	0
 Thank	0
you	0
for	0
your	0

 Exploring	0

her	0

defensiveness	0
that	0
she	0

that	0

somewhat	0
protective	0
of	0
who	0

her	0

you	0

your	0
request	1

 A	0
few	0
questions	0
I'd	0

why	0

he	0

love	0
you	0

what	0

hopes	0

why	0
are	0
you	0

 Sooner	0

this	0
will	0

up	0

that	0
you	0
are	0
either	0
not	0
stating	0
or	0
are	0
being	0
ignored	0
by	0
your	0
boyfriend.The	0
best	0
way	0
to	0
resolve	0
accumulated	0
tensions	0
is	0
to	0
slowly	0
open	0
the	0
discussion	0
between	0
the	0
two	0
people.It	0
is	0
possible	0
to	0
stay	0
together	0

 What	0

this	0

most	0

take	0

Sorry	0
that	0
your	0
growing	0
up	0
years	0

Your	0
girlfriend	0
is	0
the	0
expert	0
on	0
what	0
she	0
needs	0
and	0
wants	0
in	0
relationship	2
You	0
could	0
simply	0
say	0
to	0
her	0
that	0
you	0
know	0
you	0
still	0
have	0
a	0
lot	0
to	0
learn	0
about	0
how	0
to	0
have	0
a	0
good	0

you	0
realize	0
you're	0
not	0
yet	0
understanding	0
what	0
she	0
needs	0
and you	0
really	0
want	0
to	2
Then	0
take	0
a	0
deep	0
breath	1
settle	0
down	1
and	0
listen	2
Don't	0
argue	1
don't	0
interrupt	1
don't	0

listen	2
Let	0
her	0
know	0
what	0
you	0

that	0
you're	0

more	1

it	0

This	0

the	0
first	0
step	0
toward	0
intimacy	2

absolutely	0
normal	0

a	0
place	0
to	0

Honesty	0
is	0
the	0
only	0
way	0

"One	0
of	0

maybe	0
this	0

of	0
your	0
for	0

is	0
really	0
a	0
strength!	0

A	0

a	0

helpful:1)	0
Give	0

you're	0
right	0
that	0

they're	0
out	0

there	0
is	0
nothing	0
we	0
can	0
do	0
to	0
stop	0
them	1
but	0
I	0
want	0
to	0
offer	0
two	0
techniques	0
that	0
might	0
assist	0
with	0
your	0
panic	0
&	0
anxiety. The	0
first	0
step	0
in	0
working	0
with	0
scary	0
or	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
is	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
just	0
thoughts	0
and	0
we	0
can	0
choose	0
to	0
follow	0
the	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	0
or	0
work	0
with	0
cutting	0
them	0
off	0
or	0
ignoring	0
them	2
I	0
also	0
realize	0
that	0
might	0
seem	0
really	0
hard	0
to	0
do	1
but	0
here's	0
a	0
good	0
way	0
to	0
think	0
about	0
the	0
brain	0
and	0
how	0
thought	0
patterns	0
work	2
Thoughts	0
arise	0
in	0
the	0
mind	0
all	0
the	0
time	1
our	0
brain	0
is	0
a	0
thought	0
machine	2
Many	0
thoughts	0
drift	0
by	0
like	0
clouds	0
and	0
we	0
don't	0
pay	0
any	0
attention	0
while	0
other	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
and	0
they	0
trigger	0
us	0
in	0
a	0
particulate	0
way	1
i.e.	1
scary	1
angry	1
happy	1
sad	1
and	0
when	0
those	0
thoughts	0
arise	0
we	0
can	0
chose	0
to	0
pay	0
more	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
thought	0
which	0
can	0
lead	0
us	0
down	0
that	0
particular	0
thought	0
stream	0
that	0
will	0
lead	0
to	0
fear	0
and	0
anxiety	2
So	1
how	0
do	0
we	0
work	0
or	0
stop	0
those	0
scary	0
thought	0
streams	3
One	0
new	0
skill	0
to	0
implement	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
work	0
of	0
Rick	0
Hansen	1
he	0
wrote	0
the	0
book	0
Buddha's	0
Brain,"	0
he	0
teaches	0
that	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
give	0
more	0
energy	0
and	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
positive	0
thoughts	0
or	0
positive	0
memories	0
we	0
hold	0
in	0
our	0
mind	0
and	0
pay	0
less	0
attention	0
to	0
the	0
negative	0
thoughts	2
Hansen	0
asks	0
us	0
to	0
imagine	0
the	0
brain	0
this	0
way	1
the	0
brain	0
is	0
like	0
Velcro	0
with	0
negative	0
thoughts	0
and	0
like	0
teflon	0
when	0
it	0
comes	0
to	0
positive	0
thoughts	2
There	0
are	0
reasons	0
that	0
our	0
brain	0
works	0
this	0
way	1
but	0
I	0
don't	0
have	0
time	0
to	0
go	0
into	0
all	0
of	0
that	0
in	0
this	0
response	2
So	1
it's	0
just	0
important	0
to	0
remember	0
we	0
have	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
positive	0
thinking	1
actually	0
pausing	0
throughout	0
the	0
day	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
positive	0
feelings	0
and	0
memories	1
 this	0
will	0
help	0
the	0
mind	0
reinforce	0
positive	0
thought	0
streams	0
and	0
help	0
reduce	0
negative	0
thought	0
streams	0
over	0
time	2
If	0
a	0
scary	0
thought	0
arises	0
try	0
to	0
replace	0
it	0
with	0
a	0
happy	0
experience	0
for	0
at	0
least	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
moments	1
and	0
see	0
if	0
that	0
helps	0
reduce	0
the	0
negative	0
charge	0
connected	0
with	0
that	0
scary	0
thought. I	0
would	0
also	0
suggest	0
when	0
you're	0
having	0
the	0
thoughts	0
about	0
death	0
take	0
a	0
moment	0
to	0
notice	0
how	0
you're	0
breathing	2
Often	0
when	0
we	0
are	0
feeling	0
anxiety	0
we	0
are	0
doing	0
shallowing	0
chest	0
breathing	0
rather	0
than	0
taking	0
in	0
a	0
full	1
deep	0
breath	0
or	0
what	0
is	0
called	0
belly	0
breathing	2
If	0
you	0
take	0
a	0
moment	0
to	0
focus	0
on	0
your	0
breathing	0
and	0
allow	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
full	0
breaths	1
bringing	0
in	0
the	0
breath	0
so	0
the	0
belly	0
rises	0
and	0
then	0
the	0
belly	0
natural	0
falls	0
as	0
you	0
exhale	1
just	0
noticing	0
the	0
breath	0
and	0
practicing	0
breathing	0
can	0
slow	0
down	0
the	0
anxiety	0
cycle	0
as	0
it	0
begins	2
This	0
is	0
your	0
experience	1
your	0
feeling	0
and	0
you	0
are	0
wondering	0
if	0
it	0
is	0
normal	1
which	0
means	0
is	0
this	0

or	0
the	0
rule. This	0
question	0
about	0
how	0
you	0

 So	1
though	0
 it	0
might	0
be	0

[common	1

 to	0

  	0
 	0
It	0
sounds	0

it's	0

feel	0
down	0
when	0
your	0

Hi	0
Montgomery, Your	0
first	0
sentence	0
says	0
it	0
all	2
He	0
might	0
be	0
an	0
amazing	0
person	1
but	0
there's	0
something	0
missing	0
for	0
you	2
I'm	0
curious...you	0
say	0
this	0
is	0
a	0
long	0
distance	0
relationship	2
Did	0
you	0
make	0
a	0
connection	0
through	0
social	0
media	0
or	0
email	0
first	3
Maybe	0
a	0
dating	0
website	3
I'm	0
just	0
wondering	0
if	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
case	2
These	0
modern	0
ways	0
of	0
meeting	0
people	0
are	0
awesome	0
because	0
we	0
can	0
be	0
exposed	0
to	0
a	0
wide	0
variety	0
of	0
people	0
who	0
we	0
never	0
would	0
meet	0
in	0
the	0
grocery	0
store	0
or	0
a	0
friend's	0
party	2
There	0
are	0
complications	1
though	1
and	0
one	0
of	0
the	0
drawbacks	0
is	0
you	0
can	0
feel	0
very	0
connected	0
to	0
someone	0
and	0
care	0
about	0
them	0
a	0
great	0
deal	0
before	0
you	0
ever	0
meet	0
them	0
in	0
person	2
Then	1
when	0
you	0
finally	0
meet	0
them	0
and	0
there	0
isn't	0
that	0
spark	0
of	0
magnetic	0
physical	0
attraction	1
you're	0
in	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
difficult	0
spot	0
because	0
you've	0
already	0
established	0
that	0
you're	0
drawn	0
to	0
each	0
other	0
in	0
other	0
ways;	0
you're	0
already	0
connected	2
It	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
awkward	0
then	0
to	0
say	0
"Now	0
that	0
I	0
meet	0
you	1
it	0
doesn't	0
feel	0
the	0
way	0
it	0
should	0
for	0
me"	2
In	0
the	0
future	1
I	0
suggest	0
meeting	0
up	0
in	0
person	0
early	0
on	1
to	0
answer	0
that	0
crucial	0
question	0
"Are	0
we	0
physically	0
attracted	0
to	0
each	0
other?"	2
Clearly	1
this	0
is	0
not	0
only	0
important	0
for	0
you	1
but	0
it	0
is	0
for	0
most	0
of	0
us.My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
owe	0
this	0
man	0
your	0
affection	0
and	0
commitment	0
even	0
though	0
you're	0
not	0
really	0
all	0
that	0
into	0
him	0
(lusting	0
after	0
other	0
men	0
is	0
a	0
sign	0
of	0
that)	1
because	0
you	0
like	0
absolutely	0
everything	0
else	0
about	0
him	2
But	0
honesty	0
is	0
crucial	0
here	1
both	0
with	0
yourself	0
and	0
this	0
man	2
Just	0
because	0
you	0
don't	0
find	0
yourself	0
attracted	0
to	0
him	0
doesn't	0
mean	0
that	0
you're	0
a	0
bad	0
person	1
or	0
that	0
he's	0
not	0
attractive	2
Someone	0
else	0
might	0
drool	0
over	0
him	0
and	0
I	0
think	0
he	0
deserves	0
someone	0
who	0
does	0
just	0
that	2
You	0
can	0
have	0
both	0
love	0
and	0
lust	2
For	0
most	0
people	1
only	0
one	0
of	0
them	0
isn't	0
enough	2
It	0
is	0
absolutely	0
a	0

One	0
of	0
the	0
first	0
steps	0
is	0
to	0
manage	0
anxiety	0
and	0
depression	0
symptoms	0
are	0
to	0
establish	0
a	0
good self-care routine. 	0
Start	0
with	0
the	0
most	0
basic	0
things:	0
Eating	0
balanced	0
meals	1
sleeping	0
at	0
from	0
6-8	0
hours	0
and	0
exercise	0
at	0
least	0
30	0
minutes	0
a	0
day. 	0
These	0
will	0
help	0
you	0
to	0
regulate	0
the	0
chemical	0
imbalance	0
that affects your	0
mood	1
plus	0
exercising	0
gives	0
you	0
time	0
to	0
vent	0
and	0
be	0
distracted	0
from	0
your	0
thoughts. 	0
Once	0
basic self-care is	0
established	1
I	0
suggest	0
that	0
is	0
a	0
good	0
time	0
to	0
start	0
exploring	0
the	0
source	0
of	0
these	0
feelings	1
and	0
address	0
them	0
trough	0
therapy. 	0
If	0
you	0
have	0
difficulty	0
initiating self-care routine	0
talk	0
to	0
your	0
therapist	0
about	0
what	0
motivates	0
you	0
and	0
pushes	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
things	1
you	0
might	0
find	0
the	0
key	0
during	0
the	0
process	2
 You	0
could	0
also	0
contact	0
your	0
physician	0
or	0
a	0
psychiatrist	0
to	0
discuss	0
medication options if	0

"Imposter	0
Syndrome"	0
is	0
a	0
basic	0
effect	0
is	0
a	0
dishonest	0
cause.Basically	1
there	0
is	0
a	0
fundamental	0
lack	0
of	0
honesty	0
in	0
some	0
important	0
parts	0
of	0
your	0
life	0
(my	0
guess	0
would	0
be	0
relationships)	0
that	0
has	0
led	0
to	0
this	0
sense	0
of	0
dread	0
and	0
guilt.I	0
wonder	0
where	0
the	0
dishonesty	0
be..	2
Dealing	0
with	0
a	0
breakup	0
is	0
difficult	2
We	0
have	0
high	0
hopes	0
and	0
then	0
those	0
hopes	0
and	0
dreams	0
are	0
dashed	0
and	0
we	0
feel	0
at	0
a	0
loss	0
for	0
how	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
this	0
sudden	0
change	0
in	0
our	0
lives	2
First	1
it	0
is	0
important	0
to	0
acknowledge	0
that	0
losing	0
a	0
relationship	0
is	0
a	0
loss	0
and	0
we	0
need	0
to	0
grieve	0
that	0
loss	2
If	0
we	0
don't	0
allow	0
ourselves	0
time	0
to	0
process	0
and	0
move	0
through	0
the	0
grieving	0
process	1
we	0
may	0
remain	0
stuck	0
and	0
it	0
may	0
make	0
it	0
hard	0
to	0
move	0
on	2
So	0
in	0
some	0
ways	1
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
move	0
on	0
too	0
soon	0
by	0
just	0
trying	0
to	0
ignore	0
your	0
feelings	2
Instead	1
take	0
good	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	1
talk	0
to	0
friends	0
and	0
give	0
your	0
self	0
time	0
to	0
heal	2
The	0
second	0
most	0
important	0
thing	0
is	0
to	0
forgive	0
yourself;	0
this	0
is	0
also	0
an	0
important	0
part	0
of	0
taking	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	2
You	0
might	0
be	0
blaming	0
yourself	0
and	0
re-living	0
moments	0
when	0
you	0
wish	0
you	0
would	0
have	0
done	0
things	0
differently	2
By	0
replaying	0
those	0
thoughts	0
you	0
remain	0
stuck	2
When	0
we	0
begin	0
to	0
forgive	0
ourselves	1
we	0
truly	0
begin	0
to	0
heal	2
Lastly	1
in	0
my	0
experience	0
the	0
people	0
who	0
have	0
the	0
most	0
difficulty	0
moving	0
on	0
have	0
not	0
really	0
severed	0
all	0
ties	0
with	0
their	0
ex	2
They	0
are	0
still	0
following	0
them	0
on	0
social	0
media	0
or	0
even	0
checking	0
in	0
with	0
texts	2
This	0
is	0
probably	0
the	0
hardest	0
part	0
for	0
some	0
people	1
but	0
to	0
move	0
forward	0
there	0
needs	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
clear	0
boundary	0
and	0
a	0
clear	0
ending	2
If	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
clear	0
ending	1
you	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
new	0
beginning	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps	2
Take	0
good	0
care	0
of	0
yourself!	0
Hi	0
Texas,Oh	1
that's	0
a	0
powerful	0
idea	1
isn't	0
it	3
It	0
burrows	0
into	0
your	0
head	2
Let's	0
figure	0
this	0
out	2
First	1
has	0
your	0
partner	0
given	0
you	0
any	0
concrete	0
reason	0
not	0
to	0
trust	0
them	3
Have	0
they	0
cheated	0
before	3
If	0
not	1
then	0
they	0
deserve	0
the	0
benefit	0
of	0
the	0
doubt	0
until	0
there	0
is	0
evidence	2
If	0
it's	0
a	0
"yes"	1
then	0
it's	0
natural	0
that	0
these	0
fears	0
would	0
be	0
triggered	0
and	0
you	0
can	0
simply	0
let	0
your	0
partner	0
know	0
what	0
triggers	0
the	0
fear	0
and	0
what	0
you	0
need	2
"When	0
you	0
refuse	0
to	0
let	0
me	0
see	0
your	0
phone	0
I	0
worry	0
that	0
you're	0
hiding	0
something	2
I	0
need	0
openness"	2
If	0
they	0
haven't	0
cheated	0
on	0
you	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
there	0
are	0
three	0
possible	0
scenarios	0
here	2
I	0
invite	0
you	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
moment	0
and	0
write	0
down	0
what	0
the	0
evidence	0
is	0
that	0
cheating	0
is	0
going	0
on	2
What	0
is	0
the	0
specific	0
thing	0
that's	0
triggering	0
your	0
fears	3
When	0
you	0
have	0
your	0
data	0
recorded	1
read	0
on...The	0
first	0
scenario	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
personally	0
hurt	0
in	0
the	0
past	0
by	0
someone	0
else	0
and	0
you've	0
developed	0
fears	0
that	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
hurt	0
again	0
or	0
that	0
you're	0
not	0
enough	0
to	0
keep	0
someone	0
interested	0
(this	0
is	0
just	0
fear...people	0
cheat	0
for	0
their	0
own	0
reasons	1
not	0
because	0
we're	0
not	0
interesting)	2
This	0
may	0
be	0
true	0
if	0
what	0
you	0
wrote	0
down	0
is	0
"They	0
didn't	0
really	0
do	0
anything	0
wrong...there	0
is	0
no	0
evidence	2
I'm	0
just	0
scared	0
and	0
suspicious"	2
That's	0
a	0
cue	0
to	0
do	0
some	0
self	0
reflection	0
and	0
calm	0
yourself	0
with	0
thoughts	0
like	0
"nothing	0
has	0
really	0
happened	2
I	0
can	0
trust."If	0
what	0
you	0
wrote	0
down	0
was	0
vague	0
evidence	1
like	0
for	0
example	0
your	0
partner	0
has	0
been	0
distant	0
or	0
irritable	1
or	0
you're	0
having	0
less	0
sex	0
than	0
usual	1
you	0
can	0
try	0
to	0
approach	0
the	0
situation	0
without	0
making	0
assumptions	2
Trust	0
your	0
gut	1
but	0
your	0
gut	0
isn't	0
seeing	0
evidence	0
of	0
cheating...it's	0
evidence	0
of	0
"something"	2
Ask	0
your	0
partner	0
what's	0
up	0
with	0
accusations	0
or	0
assumptions.The	0
third	0
possibility	0
is	0
that	0
there	0
is	0
some	0
clear	0
evidence	0
that	0
they	0
are	0
cheating	2
Maybe	0
there	0
are	0
texts	0
on	0
a	0
phone	1
or	0
someone	0
has	0
told	0
you	0
something	0
they	0
saw	2
I'd	0
say	0
when	0
there	0
is	0
some	0
evidence	1
it's	0
okay	0
to	0
present	0
this	0
to	0
your	0
partner	0
and	0
ask	0
what's	0
going	0
on	2
If	0
this	0
happens	0

Hello!	0

After	0

how	0
you	0

from	0
"making	0
out"	0

"nothing	0

I	0
wondered	0
if	0
this	0
happened	0
because	0
of	0
an	0

that	0
sounded	0
like	0
"If	0
he	0
liked	0
me	1
he	0
would	0
make	0
something	0
happen."	0
A	0
truer	0

be	0
"I	0

Depression	0

both	0
be	0
chronic	0
conditions	1

This	0

that	0

It	0

Medication	0

I	0

I've	0

it	0

of	0
a	0
very	0
painful	0
time	0
in	0
their	0

is	0
your	0

that	0

the	0

step	0
is	0
to	0
directly	0
have	0
conversations	0
together	0
on	0
the	0

needs	0

what	0

the	0
marriage.Often	1
a	0
crisis	0
such	0
as	0
a	0

death	1
motivates	0
someone	0
to	0
look	0

 Keep	0
in	0

that	0

are	0
difficult	0
to	0

recommendation	0
is	0
to	0

that	0

is	0

this	0
question. Now	0
the	0
second	0
step	0
is	0
to	0
find	0
a	0
counselor	0

in	0

clients	0
with	0
Anxiety	0
and	0
Depression	2

is	0
to	0

way	0

something.Do	0
you	0

a	0

type	0
self	0

which	0
has	0
more	0

what	0
you've	0

All	0
you	0

Hi	0
Moore	1
Underneath	0
all	0
your	0
anger	0
is	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
hurt	2
The	0
hurt	0
is	0
there	0
because	0
you	0
are	0
being	0
disrespected	2
Your	0
boyfriend	0
(unless	0
you've	0
only	0
told	0
me	0
a	0
small	1
disproportionate	0
part	0
of	0
the	0
bigger	0
picture)	0
doesn't	0
tend	0
to	0
treat	0
you	0
like	0
you're	0
important	0
and	0
he	0
dismisses	0
your	0
emotions	2
This	0
is	0
happening	0
because	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
level	0
of	0
ability	0
(disability?)	0
he	0
has	0
right	0
now	0
in	0
a	0
relationship	2
You	0
can	0
expect	0
more	0
of	0
this	0
behaviour	0
(because	0
that's	0
who	0
he	0
is;	0
it	0
has	0
nothing	0
to	0
do	0
with	0
you)	1
and	0
I	0
hope	0
you	0
think	0
carefully	0
about	0
whether	0
it's	0
working	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
be	0
in	0
this. You	0
could	0
try	0
telling	0
him	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
hurt	1
because	0
people	0
tend	0
to	0
listen	0
more	0
to	0
hurt	0
than	0
to	0
anger	1
but	0
my	0
guess	0
is	0
with	0
him	0
it	0
might	0
not	0
make	0
a	0
difference	2
I	0
hope	0
you	0
talk	0
to	0
someone	0
who	0
knows	0
and	0
supports	0
you	0
about	0
how	0
you're	0
feeling	0
in	0
this	0

Hello,I'm	0
very	0
sorry	0
to	0
hear	0
about	0
the	0
loss	0

your	0

My	0
suggestion	0
would	0
be	0
to	0
look	0
into	0
community	0
mental	0
health	0
agencies	0
in	0
your	0
area	2
Sometimes	0
they	0
can	0
offer	0
low-fee	0
counseling	2
You	0
can	0
also	0
check	0
the	0
hospitals	0
in	0
your	0
area	0
because	0
they	0
may	0
offer	0
free	0
or	0
low-fee	0
bereavement	0
support	0
groups	1
which	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
helpful	2
Lastly	1
you	0
may	0
want	0
to	0
look	0
into	0
reading	0
some	0
books	0
about	0
grief	0
as	0
they	0
can	0
help	0
you	0
understand	0
the	0
general	0
effects	0
of	0
grief	0
and	0
feel	0
comforted	0
that	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
alone	2
Lastly	1
some	0
therapists	0
offer	0
sliding	0
scale	1
or	0
reduced	0
fee	0
so	0
it	0
doesn't	0
hurt	0
to	0
call	0
some	0
local	0
therapists	0
to	0
see	0
if	0
they	0
offer	0
could	0
offer	0
a	0
very	0
low-fee	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps!	0
Please	0
take	0
good	0
care	0

yourself	2
Grief	0
is	0

know	0
the	0

Hi	0
Winters	1
I'm	0
so	0
glad	0
you	0
wrote	1
because	0
I	0
think	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
young	0
women	0
experiencing	0
the	0
exact	0
same	0
thing	2
You	0
feel	0
self-loathing	0
for	0
both	0
being	0
a	0
virgin	1
and	0
for	0
being	0
sexually	0
active	2
Young	0
women	0
have	0
always	0
gotten	0
crazy	0
mixed	0
messages	0
about	0
what	0
they're	0
supposed	0
to	0
be	2
They	0
feel	0
pressure	0
to	0
be	0
pure	1
and	0
they	0
also	0
feel	0
pressure	0
to	0
be	0
the	0
vixen	0
and	0
please	0
men	0
sexually	2
But	0
you	0
can't	0
be	0
both	1
so	0
you	0
can't	0
ever	0
win	0
if	0
you	0
buy	0
into	0
all	0
that	0
horse	0
manure	0
(excuse	0
my	0
language). This	0
current	0
hook-up	0
culture	0
puts	0
added	0
pressure	0
on	0
girls	0
to	0
expect	0
nothing	0
more	0
than	0
random	0
sexual	0
encounters	0
that	0
leave	0
you	0
feeling	0
empty	0
and	0
used;	0
perhaps	0
desirable	0
in	0
that	0
moment	0
but	0
mostly	0
worthless	2
The	0
stupid	0
part	0
is	0
that	0
research	0
tells	0
us	0
that	0
young	0
men	0
are	0
also	0
impacted	0
negatively	0
by	0
this	0
cultural	0
norm	0
that	0
values	0
sex	0
and	0
not	0
relationship;	0
they	0
feel	0
guilt	1
and	0
loneliness	2
 I	0
urge	0
you	0
to	0
talk	0
to	0
other	0
girls	0
and	0
women	0
about	0
your	0
feelings	2
My	0
hope	0
and	0
prayer	0
is	0
that	0
they	0
will	0
echo	0
my	0
words	0
here.Your	0
value	0
and	0
power	0
cannot	0
ever	0
be	0
found	0
in	0
whether	0
a	0
man	0
wants	0
you	1
whether	0
you	0
turn	0
his	0
eye	1
or	0
how	0
he	0
treats	0
you	2
Your	0
sexuality	0
is	0
a	0
beautiful	0
part	0
of	0
who	0
you	0
are	1
and	0
it	0
is	0
to	0
be	0
celebrated	2
I	0
love	0
that	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
celebrate	0
it	0
with	0
someone	0
who	0
cares	2
Who	0
you	0
are	0
is	0
so	0
very	0
much	0
more	0
than	0
your	0
sexuality	2
You	0
sound	0
like	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
things	0
going	0
for	0
you	2
Try	0
to	0
see	0
all	0
of	0
those	0
things	0
when	0
you	0
think	0
of	0
yourself.There	0
are	0
many	0
more	0
virgins	0
out	0
there	1
and	0
many	0
are	0
afraid	1
like	0
you	1
that	0
they	0
don't	0
fit	0
in	2
We	0
are	0
all	0
different	1
and	0
you	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
be	0
anything	0
but	0
who	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
be;	0
who	0
you	0
are	2
You	0
don't	0
have	0
to	0
have	0
any	0
kind	0
of	0
sex	0
until	0
you're	0
ready	1
and	0
that	0
makes	0
you	0
brave	0
and	0
smart	1
not	0
weird.You're	0
tall	0
and	0
beautiful	1
and	0
guys	0
may	0
be	0
intimidated	0
by	0
that	2
It	0
may	0
take	0
time	0
for	0
you	0
to	0
meet	0
the	0
right	0
guy	1
but	0
he's	0
out	0
there	2
The	0
question	0
is:	0
How	0
do	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
spend	0
your	0
time	0
until	0
he	0
crosses	0
your	0
path? I	0
hope	0
you	0
talk	0
to	0
someone	0
soon	0
and	0
find	0
out	0
that	0
your	0
feelings	0
are	0
normal	2
I	0
wish	0
you	0
the	0
best	2
My	0
answer	0
is	0
yes	1
you	0
should	0
tell	0
her	0
because	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
child	0
with	0
her	2
She	0
is	0
the	0
mother	0
of	0
your	0
son	1
and	0
this	0
new	0
baby	0
would	0
be	0
his	0
half	0
sister	2
I	0
think	0
telling	0
her	0
is	0
mature	0
and	0
appropriate	2
Usually	0
procrastinating	0
just	0
makes	0
it	0
worse.Another	0
thing	0
to	0
consider	2
Would	0
you	0
want	0
her	0
to	0
tell	0
you	0
if	0
she	0
was	0
pregnant	0
with	0
her	0
boyfriends	0
baby	3
Hope	0
this	0
helps	1
take	0
care!	0
You're	0
in	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
good	0
company	0
and	0
it's	0
great	0
that	0
you're	0
in	0
a	0
positive	0
relationship	2
Congratulations!I	0
often	0
hear	0
people	0
talk	0
about	0
loving	0
yourself	0
and	0
self	0
esteem	2
We	0
often	0
seem	0
to	0
blame	0
ourselves	0
for	0
not	0
"loving	0
ourselves"	0
enough	0
or	0
put	0
ourselves	0
down	0
for	0
having	0
low	0
self	0
esteem	2
It	0
seems	0
to	0
me	0
that	0
since	0
we	0
are	0
essentially	0
socially	0
beings	0
and	0
in	0
fact	1
need	0
each	0
other	0
for	0
our	0
survival	1
we	0
really	0
know	0
who	0
we	0
are	0
through	0
our	0
many	0
interactions	0
with	0
others	0
and	0
with	0
our	0
environment	2
In	0
other	0
words	1
you	0
can't	0
just	0
snap	0
your	0
fingers	0
and	0
voila!	0
now	0
I	0
love	0
myself	1
where	0
there	0
was	0
an	0
empty	0
space	0
or	0
self-doubt	0
before	2
We	0
grow	0
that	0
warm	0
coal	0
inside	0
ourselves	0
through	0
the	0
friction	0
of	0
contact	0
with	0
others	0
who	0
value	0
and	0
validate	0
us	2
 Allow	0
yourself	0
to	0
be	0
patient	0
with	0
yourself	0
as	0
you	0
experience	0
this	0
new	0
relationship	2
You	0
are	0

model	0
of	0
who	0
you	0
are	0
and	0
how	0
you	0
fit	0

the	0

What	0
a	0
marvelous	0
gift	0
for	0
you! You	0
may	0

have	0
fears	0
that	0
the	0
current	0

temporary	0
or	0
unreliable	2
These	0
fears	0
of	0
loss	0
may	0
get	0
in	0
your	0
way	1
however	0
understandable	2
If	0
you	0

your	0

you	0
can	0
share	0
with	0
her	0
that	0

sometimes	0
fear	0
it	0
will	0
go	0
away	0
and	0
sometimes	0
have	0
trouble	0
really	0
trusting	0
it	2
Such	0
a	0

you	0

My	0

with	0
your	0

physician	1
because	0
you	0

some	0

symptoms	2
While	0
it	0

here	1
your	0

hopefully	0
know	0
your	0

some	0

some	0

about	0

particularly	0
in	0

Of	0

it?The	0

a	0

Your	0

that	0
you	0
are	0
a	0

that	0
he's	0
not	0

a	0

us	2
Either	0
of	0

the	0

you	0

that	0
he's	0

to	0
look	0
at	0
the	0

in	0

If	0

neither	1

at	0

you	0

you	0
can	0

whether	0

This	0
is	0
tricky	0
and	0
quite	0
delicate.I	0
wonder	0
if	0
you	0

with	0
your	0

curious	0
with	0
what	0
your	0

in	0
this	0

I	0

also	0

positively	1

even	0
that	0

at	0

about	0
your	0

these	0
are	0
all	0

 It	0
is	0
necessary	0
for	0

to	0

about	0
your	0
basic	0
future.If	0
you	0
are	0
living	0
on	0
your	0
own	0
and	0
the	0
main	0
problem	0
is	0
your	0
inner	0
adjustment	0
that	0
your	0
family	0
structure	0
is	0
completely	0
changing	1
then	0
probably	0
a	0
good	0
therapist	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
great	0
help	0
to	0
you	0
now	1
to	0
clarify	0
these	0
tensions.Sending	0
lots	0
of	0
good	0
wishes	0
for	0
an	0
easy	0
resolution	0
to	0
your	0
new	0
path!	0
The	0
short	0
answer	0
I	0
could	0
give	0
is	0
that	0
we	0
don't	0
know	0
why	0
it's	0
happening	2
The	0
longer	0
answer	0
could	0
come	0
from	0
deeper	0
exploration	0
as	0
to	0
your	0
fears	1
or	0
anxieties	1
that	0
you	0
experience	0
maybe	0
just	0
thinking	0
of	0
going	0
outside	2
But	0
any	0
sort	0
of	0
exploration	0
about	0
this	0
almost	0
HAS	0
to	0
begin	0
with	0
an	0
agreement	0
within	0
you	0
(and	0
all	0
of	0
your	0
feelings)	1
that's	0
it's	0
not	0
something	0
to	0
be	0
ashamed	0
of	2
If	0
we	0
are	0
ashamed	0
of	0
any	0
of	0
our	0
behaviors	1
then	0
we	0
lose	0
the	0
ability	0
to	0
sit	0
with	0
them	0
and	0
see	0
where	0
they	0
are	0
coming	0
from. This	0
could	0
be	0
something	0
that	0
can	0
be	0
worked	0
through	0
in	0
therapy	1
and	0
specifically	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
who	0
specializes	0
in	0
anxiety	0
and	0
more	0
specifically	1
agoraphobia	2
The	0
short	0
answer	0
is	0
yes	0
-	0
if	0
you	0
feel	0
'really	0
guilty	0
after	0
a	0
night	0
of	0
drinking'	1
then	0
you	0
probably	0
have	0
a	0
problem	2

you	0

find	0
information	0
on	0
how	0
many	0
drinks	0
is	0
too	0
much	1
and	0
the	0
general	0
answer	0
for	0
women	0
is	0
more	0
than	0
seven	0
drinks	0
in	0
a	0
week	2
There	0
is	0
also	0
a	0

if	0
your	0

is	0
a	0

that	0

Hi	0
Ohio	1
I	0
totally	0
get	0
how	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
more	0
difficult	0
to	0
forgive	0
ourselves	0
than	0
to	0
forgive	0
others	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
tend	0
to	0
come	0
down	0
too	0
hard	0
on	0
yourself	0
a	0
lot	2
That's	0
a	0
huge	0
barrier	0
to	0

that	0
you	0

I'll	0
get	0
you	0
started.You	0
feel	0

in	0
a	0

way	0
that	0
is	0
probably	0
way	0
out	0
of	0
proportion	0
to	0
the	0
incident	2
Is	0
it	0
triggering	0
some	0
old	0
shame? Unfortunately	1
a	0
lot	0

use	0
shame	0
as	0
a	0
motivator	0
for	0
kids	2
It	0
doesn't	0
work	2
When was	0
the	0
first	0
time	0
you	0
remember	0
feeling	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
shame	1
as	0
in	0
"I'm	0
bad"	1

worthless"	3
Is	0
there	0
a	0
younger	0
version	0
of	0
you	0
who	0
is	0
still	0

over	0
something	0
that	0
wasn't	0

an	0
absent	0

parent	1
sexual	0
abuse	0

some	0
family	0
loss	0

Can	0
you	0
tell	0
your	0

self	0
that	0
whatever	0

them	0
isn't	0

Can	0
you	0

compassion	0
for	0
that	0
child	0
who	0
first	0
felt	0
shame	0

had	0
shame	0
heaped	0
on	0
them? That's	0
your	0

goal...to	0

the	0

and	0
heal	0

with	0
compassion	2
What	0
happens	0

is	0
never	0
their	0

(and	0

off	1

for	0

out	0
the	0

of	0

since	0

For	0
example	1
if	0
I	0
am	0
feeling	0
down	0
about	0
a	0
particular	0
circumstance	0
in	0
my	0
life	1
then	0
I	0
start	0
seeing	0
life	0
through	0
this	0
lens	0
of	0
feeling	0
down	1
and	0
typically	0
I'll	0
start	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
lot	0
more	0
that	0
I	0
get	0
down	0
about	1
and	0
it	0
can	0
really	0
build	0
very	0
quickly	0
on	0
itself	2
Same	0
with	0
anxiety	2
Obviously	1
this	0
is	0
a	0
very	0
simplified	0
example	0
and	0
it	0
can	0
be	0
very	0
difficult	0
to	0
see	0
how	0
the	0
pattern	0
is	0
maintained	1
but	0
that's	0
where	0
working	0
with	0
a	0
counselor/therapist	0
comes	0
in. I	0
would	0
be	0
curious	0
about	0
whether	0
you	0
can	0
start	0
to	0
notice	0
the	0
initial	0
sensations	0
of	0
panic	1
and	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
(through	0
the	0
panic	0
attack)	0
continue	0
to	0
maintain	0
awareness	0
of	0
the	0
actual	0
physical	0
sensations	2
Even	0
better	0
if	0
you	0
can	0
talk	0
yourself	0
through	0
the	0
sensations	0
you're	0
feeling	0
-	0
such	0
as	0
saying	0
to	0
yourself	0
"Okay	1
I'm	0

highly	0

the	0

Anxiety	0
Management	0

the	0

piece	1

I	0

Hello, There	0
are	0
many	0
ways	0
to	0
approach	0
a	0
counselor	0
and	0
starting	0
the	0
process	1
however	0
they	0
all	0
start	0
with	0
picking	0
up	0
the	0
phone	2
 It's	0
most	0
definitely	0
an	0
uncomfortable	0
feeling	1
but	0
once	0
that	0
first	0
step	0
is	0
taken	0
it	0
is	0
often	0
met	0
with	0
a	0
wave	0
of	0
relief. My	0
recommendation	0
is	0
always	0
to	0
call	0
and	0
speak	0
with	0
a	0
therapist	0
over	0
the	0
phone	0
before	0
scheduling	0
an	0
appointment	2
Listening	0
to	0
how	0
they	0
converse	1

their	0
tone	0

give	0
you	0
a	0
brief	0

how	0
they	0

respond	0
to	0
you	0
and	0
increase	0
your	0
comfort	0
right	0
away	2
You	0
may	0
also	0

rather	0
quickly	1
that	0
this	0

right	0
match	0
for	0
you.Regardless	0
of	0
how	0

The	0
nice	0
things	0
about	0

that	0
it	0

Affairs	0
and	0
infidelity	0
are	0
tough	0
areas	0
to	0
address	2
The	0
power	0
of	0
the	0
affair	0
comes	0
from	0
the	0
feeling	0
of	0
injustice	0
that	0
seems	0
to	0
have	0
happened	0
to	0
you	2
The	0
struggle	0
I	0
notice	0
people	0
have	0
is	0
with	0
the	0
forgiveness	2
Forgiveness	0
is	0
something	0
that	0
is	0
asked	0
of	0
you	0
from	0
your	0
partner	0
but	0
also	0
you	0
have	0
the	0
power	0
to	0
give	2
I	0
assume	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
forgive	0
or	0
have	0
forgiven	2
However	1
the	0
forgetting	0
part	0
is	0
difficult. It	0
seems	0
that	0
image	0
of	0
her	0
happiness	0
may	0
have	0
triggered	0
something	0
in	0
you	0
that	0
isn't	0
happy	2
I'm	0
not	0
sure	0
how	0
often	0
you	0
are	0
triggered	0
by	0
her	0
but	0
it	0
seems	0
there	0
is	0
something	0
there	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
process	2
The	0
forgetting	0
part	0
sadly	0
is	0
difficult	0
to	0
put	0
past	0
your	0
mind	2
However	1
it's	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
see	0
the	0
unfortunate	0
situation	0
they	0
did	0
and	0
be	0
able	0
to	0
walkthrough	0
it	0
even	0
though	0
it's	0
painful	2
I	0
think	0
maybe	0
speaking	0
with	0
a	0
local	0
therapist	0
about	0
this	0
as	0
it's	0
often	0
difficult	0
to	0

alone	2
Also	1
see	0
how	0
you	0
are	0
feeling	0
as	0
days	0

Do	0
you	0
find	0

Hello	1
and	0
let	0
me	0
say	0
first	1
what	0
a	0
great	0
question! There	0
are	0
so	0
many	0
people	0
putting	0
forth	0
their	0
100%	0
everyday	0
and	0
often	0
times	1
do	0
not	0
get	0
the	0
credit	0
they	0
deserve	2
Without	0
being	0
able	0
to	0
fully	0
understand	0
where	0
you're	0
question	0
is	0
coming	0
from	1
I	0
think	0
there	0
are	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
different	0
ways	0
to	0
look	0
at	0
this	0
question.First	1
I	0
think	0
it's	0
important	0
for	0
us	0
to	0
consider	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
by	0
those	0
in	0
your	0
life	0
stating	0
that	0
you're	0
"not	0
good	0
enough."	0
Is	0
that	0
ACTUALLY	0
what	0
they	0
said	1
or	0
is	0
this	0
just	0
what	0
you	0
heard	3
Sometimes	1
because	0
of	0
our	0
own	0
self-doubts	0
and	0
fears	1
we	0
skew	0
and	0
misinterpret	0
the	0
messages	0
we	0
receive	0
from	0
others	2
Again	1
listen	0
to	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
and	0
attempt	0
to	0
remain	0
objective	2
Is	0
the	0
message	0
being	0
sent	0
coming	0
from	0
a	0
place	0
of	0
love	0
or	0
concern	3
If	0
so	1
have	0
an	0
honest	0
and	0
open	0
communication	0
with	0
that	0
individual	0
about	0
what	0
your	0
concerns	0
are	0
regarding	0
the	0
amount	0
of	0
energy	0
and	0
time	0
you're	0
spending	0
on	0
being	0
"good	0
enough."	0
Explore	0
with	0
them	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
you'r	0
already	0
giving	0
your	0
best.If	0
the	0
person	0
is	0
unwilling	0
to	0
work	0
at	0
understanding	0
this	0
concern	0
you	0
have	1
then	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
time	0
to	0
explore	0
the	0
relationship	2
Some	0
relationships	0
we	0
engage	0
in	0
can	0
be	0
toxic	1
especially	0
if	0
the	0
other	0
person	0
is	0
toxic	2
It	0
may	0
be	0
they	0
have	0
their	0
own	0
"stuff"	0
going	0
on	0
and	0
they	0
feel	0
the	0
need	0
to	0
constantly	0
put	0
others	0
down	0
to	0
make	0
themselves	0
feel	0
better	2
If	0
you're	0
in	0
the	0
direct	0
path	0
of	0
this	0
individual	1
then	0
it	0
serves	0
to	0
reason	0
you	0
will	0
probably	0
be	0
in	0
the	0
direct	0
fire	1
as	0
well	2
Explore	0
whether	0
or	0
not	0
you	0
want	0
this	0
relationship	0
to	0
continue	0
in	0
your	0
life	2
If	0
it's	0
a	0
relationship	0
that	0
MUST	0
continue	1
then	0
work	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
will	0
do	0
to	0
distance	0
yourself	0
from	0
their	0
toxicity	0
or	0
their	0
problems	2
Until	0
they're	0
willing	0
to	0
work	0
on	0
these	0
issues	0
for	0
themselves	1
then	0
it	0
may	0
be	0
necessary	0
to	0
find	0
an	0
exit	0
strategy	1
such	0
as	0
leaving	0
the	0

or	0
simply	0
refusing	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
the	0

perspective	0
of	0
this	0

exploring	0
the	0

it's	0

for	0
YOU	0
to	0
satisfy	0
the	0
expectations	0

It	0

all	0
of	0

it	0
WITHIN	0
you	0

The	0

this	0
expectation	0
you	0
have	0
for	0
yourself	0

you	0

also	0
let	0

I	0

Learning	0
what	0

work-related	1
for	0

(up	0
to	0
a	0

amount	0

wondering	1

your	0

tell	0
your	0

this	0

possible	0
that	0
you're	0
not	0
aware	0

others	3
Maybe	0
this “forced	0
counseling”	0
can	0
be	0
an	0
opportunity	0
for	0
some	0
introspection	0
on	0
your	0
part	2
Let's	0
just	0
start	0
with	0
being	0
real	2
Expressing	0
yourself	0
is	0
vulnerable	1
and	0
being	0
vulnerable	0
is	0
hard	2
It	0
takes	0
courage	0
and	0
work	0
to	0
be	0
vulnerable	2
My	0
guess	0
is	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
shown	0
in	0
your	0
lifetime	0
that	0
being	0
vulnerable	0
(ie	1
expressing	0
yourself)	0
is	0
unsafe	2
My	0
assumption	0
would	0
be	0
you	0
have	0
been	0
criticized	1
or	0
ignored	0
when	0
you	0
have	0
expressed	0
yourself	0
in	0
the	0
past	1
it	0
has	0
taught	0
your	0
emotional	0
self	0
to	0
simply	0
not	0
do	0
it	0
again	2
This	0
is	0
a	0
normal	0
protective	0
mechanism	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
used	0
to	0
cope	0
with	0
past	0
feelings	0
of	0
hurt	2
It	0
will	0
take	0
time	0
and	0
work	0
to	0
engage	0
again	0
in	0
an	0
emotional	0
way.I	0
would	0
start	0
my	0
practicing	0
and	0
identifying	0
how	0
you	0
feel	0
to	0
yourself	2
Check	0
in	0
with	0
yourself	0
multiple	0
times	0
a	0
day	0
to	0
gage	0
where	0
you	0
are	0
at	0
emotionally	2
After	0
you	0
feel	0
you	0
have	0
a	0
good	0
grasp	0
on	0
this	1
start	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
emotional	0
conversations	0
with	0
others	2
Choose	0
others	0
that	0
feel	0
safe	0
to	0
you	1
a	0
good	0
friend	0
that	0
knows	0
you	0
well	1
or	0
a	0
sibling	0
or	0
family	0
member	2
Expressing	0
yourself	0
is	0
a	0
behavior	0
that	0
you	0
have	0
suppressed	0
out	0
of	0
protection	1
so	0
you	0
can	0
choose	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
safe	0
emotional	0
expression	0
behaviors	0
just	0
the	0
same	2
Best	0
of	0

It	0
sounds	0
like	0
your	0
in	0
quite	0
a	0
rough	0
place	1
my	0
recommendation	0
just	0
based	0
on	0
what	0
you	0
type	0
might	0
warrant	0
a	0
visit	0
to	0
a	0
psychotherapist	0
to	0
resolve	0
what	0
may	0
be	0
going	0
on	1

am	0
not	0
entirely	0
sure	0

it	0
sounds	0
like	0
he	0
might	0
have	0
a	0
bit	0
of	0
a	0
sex	0
addiction	0
problem	2
One	0
thing	0
you	0
need	0
to	0
ask	0
yourself	0
is	0
"Am	0
I	0
happy?"	1
"Do	0
I	0
feel	0
loved?"	1
these	0
are	0
deep	0
questions	1
but	0
the	0
answers	0
to	0
those	0
questions	0
will	0
give	0
you	0
a	0
direction	0
to	0
travel	0
in	2
I	0
have	0
found	0
that	0
if	0
you	0
go	0
to	0
my	0
website	0
and	0
fill	0
out	0
the	0
form	1
I	0
can	0
usually	0
get	0
back	0
to	0
you	0
within	0
24	0
hours	2
In	0
my	0
most	0
efficient	0
instances	1
I've	0
been	0
able	0
to	0
set-up	0
a	0
consultation	0
within	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
days	1
which	0
is	0
just	0
15	0
minutes	0
by	0

Then	0
from	0
there	1
if	0
you	0
want	0
to	0
meet	0
in	0
person	0
we	0
can	0
set	0
up	0
an	0
initial	0
session	2
I	0
will	0
usually	0
be	0

times	0
for	0

that	0
I	0
have	0
available	0

Scheduling	0
is	0
a	0
big	0
barrier	0
to	0
finding	0
a	0
therapist	1
especially	0
in	0
New	0
York	1
when	0
schedules	0
seem	0
pretty	0
busy	0
all	0
around.I've	0
heard	0
a	0
lot	0
of	0
statistics	0
about	0
how	0
prospective	0
clients	0
in	0
therapy	0
will	0
often	0
wait	0
for	0
months	0
before	0
reaching	0
out	1
which	0
is	0
why	0
I	0
think	0
that	0
email	0
is	0
great	2
Cold-calling	0
can	0
cause	0
an	0
unnecessary	0
amount	0
of	0
anxiety	0
(also	1
who	0
will	0
hear	0
me	0
on	0
the	0
phone?)	0
whereas	0
email	0
is	0
relatively	0
easy	0
to	0
begin	0
a	0
conversation	1
from	0
what	0
I've	0
found.I	0
tend	0
to	0
recommend	0
clients	0
give	0
a	0
new	0
therapist	0
a	0
couple	0
of	0
sessions	0
to	0
get	0
a	0
feel	0
for	0
fit	2
But	1
if	0
it's	0
horrible	0
after	0
one	0
session	1
and	0
you	0
feel	0
awful	0
when	0
you	0
leave	1
that's	0
another	0
story	2
I	0
might	0
want	0
to	0
explore	0
with	0
you	0
what	0
felt	0
so	0
awful	1
but	0
if	0
you	0
don't	0
want	0
to	0
come	0
back	1
that	0
is	0
well	0
within	0
your	0
right.Also	1
keep	0
in	0

that	0
we	0

So	1
please	0
don't	0
feel	0
like	0
we	0
are	0
judging	0
you	0
for	0
seeking	0
out	0
help!	0
You	0
are	0
strong	0
for	0
doing	0
so	2
Far	0
too	0
often	0
I	0
hear	0
about	0
it	0
as	0
a	0
weakness	1
and	0
that's	0
just	0
BS:)	0
Teenage	0
years	0
are	0
rough	0
for	0
anyone	1

this	0
is	0
a	0
time	0
for	0
self-discovery	0

experimentation	2
Having	0

certainly	0
pose	0
challenges	2

The	0
problem	0
here	0
is	0
the	0
generation/age	0
gap	1

there's	0
not	0
a	0
whole	0
lot	0
you	0
can	0
do	0
about	0
that	2
What	0
you	0
can	0

accept	0
the	0
situation	0

perhaps	0
look	0
at	0
it	0
a	0
little	0

One	0
way	0
you	0
can	0
have	0
a	0
better	0

Hi	0

can	0
be	0
very	0
difficult	0
for	0

a	0
parent	0
to	0
then	0
see	0
their	0
other	0

anyone	1
so	0
I	0
understand	0
how	0
this	0
change	0
is	0
even	0
more	0
upsetting	0
to	0
you. And...your	0
father	0
and	0
your	0

have	0
clearly	0
established	0
a	0
friendship	0

fallen	0
in	0

you	0

this	0
coming	3
I	0

they	0
didn't	0
hide	0
it	0
from	0
you	2
If	0
they	0
did	1
maybe	0
this	0
is	0
the	0
issue	3
It	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
legitimate	0
one.But	0
in	0
the	0
end	1
your	0
father	1

your	0

are	0
adults	0
who	0
are	0
free	0
to	0
fall	0
in	0
love	0
with	0
whomever	0
they	0

very	0
powerful	2
If	0
all	0
you	0

annoying	0
you	0

you	0

that	0
will	0

annoying	2
Your	0
intense	0

it	0

yourself	0

effect.You	0
don't	0

She	0
seems	0
to	0

My	0

is	0
that	0
your	0
most	0
annoying	0
trait	0
might	0
be	0
your	0
negative	0
self-talk	2
How	0
ironic	0
is	0
that?There's	0
another	0
irony	0
here...your	0
goal	0
is	0
to	0
be	0
a	0
better	0
partner...but	0
when	0
you	0
are	0
self-critical	1
your	0

on	0
you	1
not	0
her	2
Every	0
moment	0
that	0

Fear	0
steals	0
your	0
ability	0

your	0

take	0
a	0
moment	0
to	0

you...all	0

you	0
are	0
engulfed	0

a	0
few	0
of	0
the	0
major	0
ones	0

Stress	1
if	0
left	0

has	0
many	0
negative	0
health	0
related	0
implications	2
First	0
and	0
foremost	0
I	0
would	0
recommend	0
going	0
to	0
see	0
a	0
counselor	0
at	0
your	0
college/university	2
Most	0
colleges	0
have	0
counseling	0
centers	0
for	0
students	0
that	0
usually	0
allow	0
for	0
5-6	0
free	0
counseling	0
sessions	0
(your	0
tuition	0
actually	0
pay	0
for	0
these	0
sessions	0
so	0
take	0
advantage	0
of	0
them)	2
Secondly	0
I	0
would	0
advise	0
you	0
to	0
take	0
a	0
minute	0
and	0
breathe	2
When	0
confronted	0
with	0
overwhelming	0
life	0
issues	0
it	0
is	0
common	0
to	0
busy	0
ourselves	0
in	0
an	0
attempt	0
to	0
distract	0
ourselves	0
from	0
the	0
drama	1
but	0
sometimes	0
that	0
can	0
compound	0
our	0
stress	2
When	0
dealing	0
with	0
stress	0
it	0
is	0
important	0
that	0
you	0
engage	0
in	0
self	0
care	2
In	0
other	0
words	0
find	0
time	0
to	0
engage	0
in	0
activities	0
that	0
bring	0
you	0
a	0
sense	0
of	0
peace	1
enjoyment	1
and	0
fulfillment	0
in	0
order	0
that	0
you	0
may	0
get	0
a	0
momentary	0
release	0
from	0
your	0
daily	0
hectic	0
life	2
Even	0
with	0
a	0
normal	0
life	0
there	0
is	0
no	0
way	0
to	0
escape	0
stress	1
it	0
is	0
inevitable	0
and	0
a	0
part	0

how	0
you	0

you	0
take	0
care	0
of	0
yourself	0
in	0
the	0

of	0
these	0
whirlwind	0
events	0
will	0
determine	0
your	0
quality	0
of	0
life	2
I	0
hope	0
this	0
helps..	2
Perhaps	0
you	0
are	0
not	0
ready	0
to	0
come	0
out	0
to	0
your	0
parents. 	0
Often	0
times our	0
readiness	0
is	0
not	0
dependent	0
on	0
what	0
others'	0
will	0
say	0
or	0
how	0
they react. But	0
more	0
so	0
dependent	0
on how	0
emotionally	0
prepared	0
we	0
are	0
to	0
deal	0
with	0
others'	0
reactions. 	0
It may	0
be beneficial	0
for	0
you to	0
play	0
out	0
each	0
possible scenario	0
and conclusion	0
(eg	2
your	0
parents	0
being	0
supportive	0
vs	2
your	0

Another	0
helpful	0
piece	0
of	0
info	0
on	0
anxiety	1
is	0
that	0
it	0
is	0
prone	0
to	0
something	0
called	0
"symptom	0
stress"	0
-	0
being	0
anxious	0
about	0
anxiety	2
If	0
we	0
could	0
hear	0
this	0
symptom	0

it	0
might	0
sound	0

"Oh	0

such	0
as	0
"I	0
can't	0
stand	0
being	0

and	0
"this	0

You	0

the	0
idea.We	0
can	0
increase	0

counteract	0
it	0
with	0
calming	0
and	0
reassuring	0
self-talk	2
We	0
have	0
the	0
ability	0

we	0
